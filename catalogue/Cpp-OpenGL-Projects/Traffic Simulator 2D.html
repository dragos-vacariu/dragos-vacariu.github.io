                    <b>2D Traffic Simulator</b> was an early ambitious project developed from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. 
                    The goal was to simulate a dynamic traffic environment with features such as:
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li>Predefined driving patterns for AI-controlled vehicles</li>
                        <li>Dynamic speed variations</li>
                        <li>Simulated time progression with day-to-night transitions</li>
                        <li>Adaptive traffic density based on the in-game time (reduction and repopulation)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Although the project was never fully completed, it played a significant role in my growth as a developer. 
                    It offered hands-on experience in areas such as:
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li>Core programming and algorithm design</li>
                        <li>Texture filtering and photo editing for visual assets</li>
                        <li>Code optimization and performance tuning</li>
                        <li>Low-level hardware interaction and OpenGL API usage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Through this experience, I developed a deeper appreciation for the challenges game developers face when working 
                    close to the metal â€” particularly when writing custom shaders for lighting, textures, and visual effects. 
                    It provided valuable insight into how rendering pipelines interact with GPU hardware.
