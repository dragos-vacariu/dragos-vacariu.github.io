                    <b>Car Game Project 2D</b> is one of my most recent projects, developed entirely from scratch using C++ and OpenGL.
                    <br><br>
                    While it may appear simple at first—with PNG-based graphics and limited player interaction—it required significant 
                    effort due to the low-level nature of both C++ and OpenGL, which lack the conveniences of higher-level languages, 
                    APIs, or modern game frameworks.
                    <br><br>
                    This project builds upon the foundations laid in earlier efforts, including the
                    <a href ="./Traffic Simulator 2D.html">Traffic Simulator 2D</a>, also developed using C++ and OpenGL.
                    <br></br>
                    <b>Game Mechanics</b>
                    The objective is to drive through traffic while avoiding collisions. The player earns:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>+10 points</b> for overtaking another car,</li>
                        <li><b>–5 points</b> for colliding with a traffic car,</li>
                        <li><b>–1 point</b> for each car that overtakes the player.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>Technical Challenges and Solutions</b>
                        <br><br>
                        <b>&check; Road and Curves</b><br>
                        OpenGL lacks built-in support for curved surfaces, so I had to experiment with mathematical functions and 
                        rendering techniques (e.g., scanline drawing, quad distortion) to simulate a dynamically curving road.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>&check; Traffic Car AI</b><br>
                        To ensure AI cars follow the road correctly, I implemented a custom system that adjusts their position and heading based on the 
                        road's curvature. This allows AI cars to steer naturally, regardless of direction.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>&check; Animation and Effects</b><br>
                        Without built-in animation support, I developed custom logic for effects. For example, on collision, the area around the player's 
                        car fades in and out by modifying opacity over time.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>&check; Texture-Based HUD</b><br>
                        OpenGL doesn't support text rendering natively. I used SDL_Surface objects to render text and converted them into OpenGL 
                        textures to build a heads-up display (HUD).
                        <br><br>
                        <b>&check; Traffic Car Spawning and Recycling</b><br>
                        I implemented logic to spawn traffic cars while avoiding immediate collisions. A major challenge was managing cars that 
                        became stationary due to collisions—they would linger off-screen and block new spawns. I solved this by tracking 
                        Y-positions and recycling cars only when they leave the visible or active world space.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>&check; Car Steering Animation</b><br>
                        To simulate the car turning, I created a system where the player's car quad rotates proportionally to steering input, 
                        mimicking the behavior of more advanced game engines.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>&check; Infinite World System</b><br>
                        I built a looping world using reusable segments. As the player progresses, old segments are recycled to the end of the world 
                        queue, creating a seamless scrolling environment.
