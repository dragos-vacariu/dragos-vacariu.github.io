                        <b>Car Game Project 2D</b> is one of my most recent projects, developed entirely from scratch using C++ and OpenGL.
                        <br><br>
                        While it may appear simple at first—with PNG-based graphics and limited player interaction—it required significant 
                        effort due to the low-level nature of both C++ and OpenGL, which lack the conveniences of higher-level languages, 
                        APIs, or modern game frameworks.
                        <br><br>
                        This project builds upon the foundations laid in earlier efforts, including the
                        <a href ="./Traffic Simulator 2D.html">Traffic Simulator 2D</a>, also developed using C++ and OpenGL.

                        <b>Game Mechanics</b>
                        <br></br>
                        The objective is to drive through traffic while avoiding collisions. The player earns:
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li><b>+10 points</b> for overtaking another car,</li>
                            <li><b>–5 points</b> for colliding with a traffic car,</li>
                            <li><b>–1 point</b> for each car that overtakes the player.</li>
                            <li>Game Over occurs when the player's car accumulates over 100% damage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Additional gameplay dynamics:</b>
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li>The player's speed is significantly reduced when leaving the road or during collisions.</li>
                            <li>Damage severity depends on the type and direction of the collision:</li>
                            <li>Side collisions cause minor damage.</li>
                            <li>Frontal collisions with cars moving in the same direction cause moderate damage.</li>
                            <li>Frontal collisions with cars moving in the opposite direction cause severe 
                            damage due to the combined impact forces.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>Technical Challenges and Solutions</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <b>&check; Road and Curves</b><br>
                            OpenGL lacks built-in support for curved surfaces, so I had to experiment with mathematical functions and 
                            rendering techniques (e.g., scanline drawing, quad distortion) to simulate a dynamically curving road.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>&check; Traffic Car AI</b><br>
                            To ensure AI cars follow the road correctly, I implemented a custom system that adjusts their position and heading based on the 
                            road's curvature. This allows AI cars to steer naturally, regardless of direction.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>&check; Animation and Effects</b><br>
                            Without built-in animation support, I developed custom logic for effects. For example, on collision, the area around the player's 
                            car fades in and out by modifying opacity over time.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>&check; Texture-Based HUD</b><br>
                            OpenGL doesn't support text rendering natively. I used SDL_Surface objects to render text and converted them into OpenGL 
                            textures to build a heads-up display (HUD).
                            <br><br>
                            <b>&check; Traffic Car Spawning and Recycling</b><br>
                            I implemented logic to spawn traffic cars while avoiding immediate collisions. A major challenge was managing cars that 
                            became stationary due to collisions—they would linger off-screen and block new spawns. I solved this by tracking 
                            Y-positions and recycling cars only when they leave the visible or active world space.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>&check; Car Steering Animation</b><br>
                            To simulate the car turning, I created a system where the player's car quad rotates proportionally to steering input, 
                            mimicking the behavior of more advanced game engines.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>&check; Infinite World System</b><br>
                            I built a looping world using reusable segments. As the player progresses, old segments are recycled to the end of the world 
                            queue, creating a seamless scrolling environment.
