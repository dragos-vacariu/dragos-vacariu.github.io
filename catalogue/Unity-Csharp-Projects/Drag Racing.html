                    <b>Unity Racing Environment</b>  is a prototype inspired by drag racing, where players must time their gear 
                    shifts perfectly by synchronizing the ideal RPM. The first car to cross the finish line wins.
                    <br><br>
                    Executing perfect shifts and drafting behind an opponent provide speed boosts, giving players a strategic 
                    edge to overtake rivals.
                    <br><br>
                    This environment was built using the same core principles as an 
                    <a href="../Java-Projects/Java Racing Environment.html">earlier version</a>
                    developed in Java.
                    <br><br>
