                        <b>Basic MP3 Player (C# / .NET Framework)</b>
                        <br><br>
                        This was one of my early projects, developed using C# and the .NET Framework during the 
                        initial stages of learning programming. The project served as a foundational exercise in 
                        desktop application development and working with audio libraries in C#.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite its simplicity, the player is fully capable of:
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li>Playing .mp3 files</li>
                            <li>Saving and managing playlists by writing the file paths of selected tracks to a .
                            txt file, which can later be loaded back into the player</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        The focus of this project was to understand the basics of UI design, event handling, file I/O, 
                        and integrating external resources (such as media libraries) into a desktop application.
