                    <b>WWBM Quizz Game</b> is a desktop GUI application developed using the .NET Framework during the early days of 
                    learning programming. Inspired by the popular TV Show: <b>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</b>, the game offers a 
                    quiz-style experience designed to test the player's general knowledge across a wide range of topics.

                        </br></br>
                        The player has to answer correctly to general knowledge questions of various 
                        difficulty from various fields such as: 
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li>Cinema</li>
                            <li>Music</li>
                            <li>Geography</li>
                            <li>Biology</li>
                            <li>Chemistry</li>
                            <li>Astronomy</li>
                            <li>Literature</li>
                            <li>Internet</li>
                            <li>Technology</li>
                            <li>History</li>
                            <li>and so on.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The game includes a pool of approximately <b>200 unique questions</b>, each with four possible answers.
                        As players progress and earn virtual money by answering correctly, they unlock items in the <b>Item Shop</b>, 
                        which can enhance gameplay. Available items include:
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li>Second Chance – allows the player to continue the game even after a wrong answer</li>
                            <li>Answer Reduction – eliminates one or more incorrect options from the question</li>
                            <li>Money Multipliers – increase the virtual earnings for correct answers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        This project was a great opportunity to explore event-driven programming, data handling, and user interface design in C#.
