                    <b>Basic MP3 Player (C# / .NET Framework)</b>
                    <br><br>
                    This was one of my early projects, developed using C# and the .NET Framework during the 
                    initial stages of learning programming. The project served as a foundational exercise in 
                    desktop application development and working with audio libraries in C#.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite its simplicity, the player is fully capable of:
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li>Playing .mp3 files</li>
                        <li>Saving and managing playlists by writing the file paths of selected tracks to a .
                        txt file, which can later be loaded back into the player</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    The focus of this project was to understand the basics of UI design, event handling, file I/O, 
                    and integrating external resources (such as media libraries) into a desktop application.
