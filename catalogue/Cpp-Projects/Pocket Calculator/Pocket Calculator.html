                        <b>Pocket Calculator</b> was one of my early programming projects, created with the goal of replicating the 
                        look and feel of the classic Windows Calculator. Over the course of a few focused days, I successfully 
                        implemented the core functionality, including basic arithmetic operations and a functional graphical interface.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the key challenges I encountered was managing the correct order of operations (operator precedence) in more 
                        complex calculations. At the time, implementing a proper expression parser proved to be a bit beyond my experience level, 
                        and this part of the logic remained incomplete.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite that, the project gave me valuable hands-on experience in:
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li>Designing user interfaces</li>
                            <li>Handling input and output in GUI environments</li>
                            <li>Structuring event-driven logic</li>
                            <li>Thinking through the logic behind calculator functionality</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        This project marked a meaningful step in my development journey and laid the groundwork for deeper learning in 
                        both UI development and algorithm design.
