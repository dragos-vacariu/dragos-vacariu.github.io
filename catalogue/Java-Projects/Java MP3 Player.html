                    <b>Java MP3 Player</b> is a desktop music player application developed during my early programming days, 
                    using Java, the NetBeans 8.2 IDE, and the Swing GUI toolkit. It builds upon an earlier 
                    <a href="../CSharp-Projects/MP3Player.html">MP3 Player</a>
                    I created in C#, offering enhanced functionality and a more refined user interface.
                    <br><br>
                    Key improvements include:
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li>A more polished and responsive GUI using Java Swing components</li>
                        <li>Support for creating, saving, and loading playlists via .txt files</li>
                        <li>Playlist functionality with serialization and deserialization, allowing 
                        users to save and reload their music collections across sessions</li>
                        <li>A visual playlist viewer using a JList (listbox), enabling users to browse 
                        and manage their current tracklist more easily</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    This project helped solidify my understanding of Javaâ€™s GUI capabilities, file handling, and basic 
                    object serialization while continuing to explore media integration in desktop applications.
