                        <b>Java Racing Environment</b> is a racing simulation project developed during my early days of programming, 
                        using Java, the NetBeans 8.2 IDE, and the Swing GUI toolkit. Inspired by the drag racing mechanics from 
                        older <b>Need for Speed</b> titles, this project was a bold attempt to simulate game-like behavior in a non-game 
                        engine environment.
                        <br><br>
                        At the time, I had no prior experience with graphics APIs or dedicated game engines. As a result, I opted to use 
                        Java’s Swing library to simulate racing interactions through GUI components. For example:
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li>Car visuals were displayed using JLabel elements with images.</li>
                            <li>Progress bars represented race progress for each racer.</li>
                            <li>HUD elements such as speed, gear, and performance stats were displayed using labels and text fields.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </br>
                        Despite lacking real-time rendering, physics simulation, or advanced mechanics, I managed to create a functional and 
                        visually engaging prototype that could serve as the foundation for a full-fledged racing game.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Core Gameplay Mechanics:</b>
                        <br><br>
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li><b>1 v 1 Race Events:</b><br>
                        The player competes against AI-controlled opponents with unique attributes like top speed, acceleration, 
                        and reaction time. Each event is structured as a best-of-three format — win 2 out of 3 rounds to defeat the 
                        opponent and unlock the next one.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Progression System:</b><br>
                        If the player loses two races in a row, the current challenge resets, and the player must defeat the same 
                        opponent again to progress. A total of 110 opponents are available throughout the career mode.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Betting System:</b><br>
                        Players can place bets before races. The size of the stake depends on the win/loss history between the player 
                        and opponent. Winning reduces future stakes against that opponent, while losing increases them.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Rewards & Prizes:</b><br>
                        Players earn money and experience based on race performance. Prize amounts scale with driver stats and past 
                        matchups with each opponent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>Cars, Customization & Garage</b>
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li>New vehicles become available in the Car Lot as the player advances.</li>
                            <li>The Garage allows performance upgrades through improvement packages.</li>
                            <li>Owned vehicles are stored in the Safehouse.</li>
                            <li>There is no limit to the number of cars or amount of money the player can accumulate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>Game Mechanics & Features</b>
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li><b>Gear Shifting:</b><br>
                            Inspired by old-school drag racing, gear changes are manual. Timing shifts perfectly with the correct 
                            RPM provides acceleration boosts, simulating “perfect shifts.”
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Collisions & Penalties:</b><br>
                            While physics-based collision handling wasn’t implemented, the game penalizes the player when traffic 
                            collisions occur by reducing speed and acceleration for the remainder of the event.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Player Experience System:</b><br>
                            XP is awarded based on performance — frequent collisions reduce experience gain, while perfect shifts 
                            and wins against skilled opponents increase it. Higher experience levels reduce traffic frequency in future races.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>Reflections</b>
                        Although this project lacks real-time 2D/3D graphics or physics engines, it served as a major stepping stone in 
                        my programming journey. It taught me how to:
                        <ul class="regular_ul">
                            <li>Work with GUI elements in non-graphical environments</li>
                            <li>Organize event-driven logic and simulate game-like systems</li>
                            <li>Think critically about design decisions, gameplay balancing, and user interaction</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Combining this Java-based simulator with my more recent 
                        <a href="../Unity-Csharp-Projects/Drag Racing.html">Unity Racing Environment</a> 
                         would result in a powerful hybrid — blending 
                        game mechanics with modern rendering and interaction.
