                    <b>Java Racing Environment</b> is a racing simulation project developed during my early days of programming, 
                    using Java, the NetBeans 8.2 IDE, and the Swing GUI toolkit. Inspired by the drag racing mechanics from 
                    older <b>Need for Speed</b> titles, this project was a bold attempt to simulate game-like behavior in a non-game 
                    engine environment.
                    <br><br>
                    At the time, I had no prior experience with graphics APIs or dedicated game engines. As a result, I opted to use 
                    Java’s Swing library to simulate racing interactions through GUI components. For example:
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li>Car visuals were displayed using JLabel elements with images.</li>
                        <li>Progress bars represented race progress for each racer.</li>
                        <li>HUD elements such as speed, gear, and performance stats were displayed using labels and text fields.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </br>
                    Despite lacking real-time rendering, physics simulation, or advanced mechanics, I managed to create a functional and 
                    visually engaging prototype that could serve as the foundation for a full-fledged racing game.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Core Gameplay Mechanics:</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                    <li><b>1 v 1 Race Events:</b><br>
                    The player competes against AI-controlled opponents with unique attributes like top speed, acceleration, 
                    and reaction time. Each event is structured as a best-of-three format — win 2 out of 3 rounds to defeat the 
                    opponent and unlock the next one.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Progression System:</b><br>
                    If the player loses two races in a row, the current challenge resets, and the player must defeat the same 
                    opponent again to progress. A total of 110 opponents are available throughout the career mode.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Betting System:</b><br>
                    Players can place bets before races. The size of the stake depends on the win/loss history between the player 
                    and opponent. Winning reduces future stakes against that opponent, while losing increases them.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Rewards & Prizes:</b><br>
                    Players earn money and experience based on race performance. Prize amounts scale with driver stats and past 
                    matchups with each opponent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>Cars, Customization & Garage</b>
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li>New vehicles become available in the Car Lot as the player advances.</li>
                        <li>The Garage allows performance upgrades through improvement packages.</li>
                        <li>Owned vehicles are stored in the Safehouse.</li>
                        <li>There is no limit to the number of cars or amount of money the player can accumulate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>Game Mechanics & Features</b>
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li><b>Gear Shifting:</b><br>
                        Inspired by old-school drag racing, gear changes are manual. Timing shifts perfectly with the correct 
                        RPM provides acceleration boosts, simulating “perfect shifts.”
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Collisions & Penalties:</b><br>
                        While physics-based collision handling wasn’t implemented, the game penalizes the player when traffic 
                        collisions occur by reducing speed and acceleration for the remainder of the event.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Player Experience System:</b><br>
                        XP is awarded based on performance — frequent collisions reduce experience gain, while perfect shifts 
                        and wins against skilled opponents increase it. Higher experience levels reduce traffic frequency in future races.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <b>Reflections</b>
                    Although this project lacks real-time 2D/3D graphics or physics engines, it served as a major stepping stone in 
                    my programming journey. It taught me how to:
                    <ul class="regular_ul">
                        <li>Work with GUI elements in non-graphical environments</li>
                        <li>Organize event-driven logic and simulate game-like systems</li>
                        <li>Think critically about design decisions, gameplay balancing, and user interaction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Combining this Java-based simulator with my more recent 
                    <a href="../Unity-Csharp-Projects/Drag Racing.html">Unity Racing Environment</a> 
                     would result in a powerful hybrid — blending 
                    game mechanics with modern rendering and interaction.
