                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <h4>
                    This application was developed in JAVA using NetBeans 8.2 IDE and java.Swing GUI Interface.</br></br>
                    
                    The environment is trying to simulate the Drag Racing behavior defined in older Need For Speed games:</br></br>
                    
                    The player has to compete against different AI opponents with different stats and characteristics such as: such as: 
                    top speed, acceleration, driving skills within 1:1 Race Events. The player progresses through by winning at 
                    least one event with the given opponent. The event is won by first who wins 2 of 3 rounds. Once an opponent is defeated
                    the next one become available. If the opponent wins 2 succesive races then the driver record resets such that the player will 
                    need to challenge the opponent again and win it again, in order to progress further. </br></br>
                    
                    A betting system was implemented in order to add a stake to
                    the race events. Placing a bet is one way to earn money, the amount of money that the player can bet on, 
                    depends on the driver records that the player and the given opponent has: wins vs losses. When 
                    the player wins the race the stake of the future bets with the given opponent is gonna decrease, 
                    and when the player loses the stake will raise. </br></br>
                    
                    The player also wins prizes through racing. The race prize also depend on the driver experience and also the person records that the 
                    player had with a particular opponnent.    </br></br>    
                    
                    About Cars: More cars become available in the Car Lot as the player progresses.
                    The performance of every car is customizable, there are improvement packages available for purchase within 
                    the Garage.  The player can own an unlimited amount of cars, and money up to billions. 
                    The cars owned get stored in the Safehouse.</br></br>
                    
                    About shifting gears: In older NFS games the player has to manually switch the gears and to synchronize 
                    with the RPM for a perfect gear shift. The perfect shifts is the ability of gearing at the proper RPM. Each perfect
                    shift boosts up the acceleration and gives a speed boost until the end of the race event. </br></br>
                    
                    About Collisions: A collision is the impact that the car has with the traffic - unfortunately, at that time, I lacked 
                    the means to create an environment capable of simulating physics, drawing graphics or supporting the rendenring of 
                    textures and animations in order to provide a game experience. A collision with the traffic will decrease the car speed and 
                    lower the acceleration until the end of the race event. </br></br>
                    
                    Carreer Completion: To complete the game the player has to defeat all the opponents in 1:1 race events. 
                    Defeating an opponent. The total number of opponents available is 110.</br></br>
                    
                    Player Experience: The amount of experience that the player gains depends on the perfomance 
                    shown on within the race event. More collisions will result in less amount of experience being gained whereas 
                    more perfect shifts, higher amount of experience being gained. Defeating high-skilled drivers, also increases 
                    the player's experience. Experience decreases the traffic that the player has to face.
