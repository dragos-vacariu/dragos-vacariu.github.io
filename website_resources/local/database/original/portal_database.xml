            OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions 
            that perform operations on the data, 
            while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both 
            data and functions.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>
            Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            OOP is faster and easier to execute;<br></br>
            OOP provides a clear structure for the programs;<br></br>
            OOP helps to keep the code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code 
            easier to maintain, modify and debug;<br></br>
            OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and 
            shorter development time;
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition 
            of code. <br></br>
            You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, 
            and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

            <green>Terminology:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Classes:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A class is a user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set 
            of attributes that 
            characterize any object/instance of the class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Attributes:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The attributes are data members (class variables and 
            instance variables) and methods, accessed using the <code>.</code> operator.
            The attributes are also refered to as: fields/variables and methods/properties.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Class variables:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances 
            of a class.
            <br></br>
            Class variables are defined within a class but 
            outside any of any class method. 
            <br></br>
            Typically in OOP languages class variables are 
            defined using the static keyword.
            <br></br>
            Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Instance variables:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            An instance variable is a non-static variable that is defined 
            inside a class and belongs only to the current instance of a 
            class. Instance variables
            can be refered to by using this keyword in languages such as: C++, C#, Java,
            JavaScript or by using self keyword in Python.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Data member:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A data member is a class variable or instance variable that 
            holds data associated 
            with a class and its objects.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Function overloading:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Function overloading is the assignment of more than one behavior to a 
            particular function.
            The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Instance:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            An instance is an individual object of a certain class. 
            An instance of an object is created
            by involking the constructor of the object. 
            The process of creating an object is 
            called
            instanciation or instancing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Method:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A method is another name given to a function that is defined 
            within a class definition. Methods
            can also belong to the class or to the instance.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Object:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            An instance of the class is also called as an object.
            An object is a data structure that's defined by its class.
            <br></br>
            An object comprises from both data members (class variables 
            and instance variables) and methods.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Operator overloading:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The assignment of more than one function to a particular 
            operator is called operator 
            overloading. Via operator overloading, an operator can be customized
            so that it produces the desired behaviour on complex data types such as 
            objects.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Class members vs. Instance members:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A member is either a variable or a method. 
            A method belonging to the class is
            defined in most OOP languages by using the static keyword.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Class methods or variables
            cannot be refered to by using this or self keywords. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Class methods and variables can be accessed without an 
            instance
            of the class by using the name of the class followed by the 
            . operator.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Class members cannot be combined with instance members. 
            Meaning we cannot have a class method
            that would access an instance member. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Class methods cannot directly access instance variables 
            and instance methods but the reversed way is possible: 
            instance methods can access class variables and 
            class methods directly.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>OOP Concepts:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Typically an object-oriented programming language 
            has 4 fundamental concepts:
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            1. Inheritance<br></br>
            2. Polymorphism<br></br>
            3. Encapsulation<br></br>
            4. Abstraction<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
        </oop>
        <encapsulation>
            The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from 
            users.<br></br><br></br> 
            To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as <code>private</code> 
            (cannot be accessed from outside the class). <br></br><br></br>
            If you want others to read or modify 
            the value of a <code>private</code> member, you can provide <code>public</code> get and 
            set methods.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            <green>
            Conventions:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            - good programmers use private fields for a class. 
            (A field is a variable declared in the class)
            <br></br>
            - good programmers use at least a constructor for a class. 
            (And that constructor is used to initialize the
            fields.)
            <br></br>
            - good programmers use encapsulation for controling the value 
            that get in or get out from the fields
            <br></br>
            - a method inside a class is also called 
            property of the class, 
            there can be public or private properties
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            Encapsulation is one of the 4 OOP fundamental concepts.
            <br></br>
        </encapsulation>
        <polymorphism>
            Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many 
            classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Polymorphism is the act of creating a collection of different 
            object types which are inherited from the same 
            base class. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A polymorphic type is one whose operations can also be 
            applied to values of some other type, or types. 
            When calling a virtual function from any 
            derived class the overrided method will be invoked not the 
            original one.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>There are several fundamentally different kinds of polymorphism:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Ad hoc polymorphism: when a function has different implementations 
            depending on a limited range of individually specified types 
            and combinations. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Ad hoc polymorphism: is supported in many languages using 
            function overloading.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Parametric polymorphism: when the code is written without 
            mention of any specific type and thus can be used transparently with any 
            number of new types. 
            In the object-oriented programming community, this is often known as 
            generics or generic programming.
            <br></br>
            In the functional programming community, 
            this is often shortened to polymorphism. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Subtyping (also called subtype polymorphism or 
            inclusion polymorphism): when a name denotes instances of 
            many different classes related by some common superclass.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Polymorphism is one of the 4 OOP fundamental concepts.
            <br></br>
        </polymorphism>
        <simple-data-types>
            In programming, data type refers to the type of value a variable 
            as and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied 
            without causing an error.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A data type is an attribute associated with a piece of 
            data (variable) that tells a computer system how to interpret its value.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Data-types in Programming:</green>

        <complex-data-types>
            In Programming, a data type is an attribute associated with a 
            piece of data that tells a computer system how to 
            interpret its value. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <green>
                Data types that are derived from fundamental data types:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>bool type</code> - The bool type is a byte-sized type that can only hold the value true or false.<br></br><br></br>
            <code>Enumerated type / Enums</code> - An <code>enum</code> is a special type that represents a group of constants 
            (unchangeable values).
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>Arrays</code> - A collection of elements of the same data type. <br></br>
            These entities or elements can be of <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>char</code>, or <code>double</code> 
            data type or can be of <code>user-defined</code> data types such as    like <code>structures</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            The size of an array can be calculated by multiplying the <code>data-type * numberOfElements</code> within the array.
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>Pointers</code> - A variable that stores the memory address of another variable. 
            <br></br>
            The size of a pointer varies depending on factors such as the operating system and CPU 
            architecture.<br></br><br></br>
            
            Typically, on a <code>32-bit</code> computer system, the size of pointer is <code>4 bytes</code>,    
            while on a <code>64-bit</code> computer system, it is <code>8 bytes</code>.
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>Structures</code> - A collection of variables of different data types grouped 
            together under a single name. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            The size of a <code>struct</code> can be calculated by summing up the size of all the element data-types.
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>Unions</code> - A special type of structure that can store only one value at a time. <br></br><br></br>
            
            The size of the <code>union</code> is equal to the size of the largest element defined within the union.
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>Typedefs</code> - A way to create a new name for an existing data type to improve code 
            readability and maintainability.<br></br><br></br>
            <code>void</code> - It's used to indicate an empty data type, usually used with pointers.<br></br>
        </complex-data-types>
        <loops>
            In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is 
            continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data 
            and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a 
            counter has reached a prescribed number.

            If the test condition will 
            become false then it will break from the while loop else body will be executed.

            <brown>For loop:</brown><br></br><br></br>
            For loop uses a loop variable to control the loop. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Firstly the loop variable is initialized with some value.<br></br>
            Then its test condition is checked. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            If the 
            statement is true then control will move to the body and the body of for 
            loop will be executed. 
            <br></br>
            Steps will be repeated untill the test condition becomes false. 
            <br></br>
            When the test condition will be false the loop will exit.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            Initialization Expression: In this expression, we assign a loop variable 
            or loop counter to some value. <br></br>
            Example: <code>int counter=1;</code>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            Test Expression: In this expression, test conditions are performed.
            <br></br>            
            If the condition evaluates to true then the loop body will be executed and 
            then an update of the loop variable is done. 
            <br></br>
            If the test expression becomes 
            false then the control will exit from the loop. <br></br>
            Example: <code>counter&lt;5;</code>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            Update Expression: After execution of the loop body loop variable is updated 
            by some value. <br></br>
            It could be incremented, decremented, multiplied, or divided by 
            any value. <br></br>
            Example: <code>counter++;</code><br></br><br></br>

<code>
/*For loop syntax: */
for(int counter = 0; counter &lt; 5; counter++)
{
    /*code goes here*/
}
</code>
            <br></br>        
            <brown>Do-while loop:</brown><br></br><br></br>
            The do-while loop is similar to a while loop but the only difference 
            lies in the do-while loop test condition which is tested at the end of 
            the body. <br></br>
            In the do-while loop, the loop body will execute at least once 
            irrespective of the test condition.<br></br><br></br>
<code>
/*Do while loop syntax: */
do
{
    /*code goes here*/
     counter++;
}
while(counter &lt; 5)

        <dynamic-memory-allocation>
            Dynamic memory is allocated from the heap using some standard library functions. 
            The two dynamic memory key functions are <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>malloc()</code> function takes a single parameter, which is the size of the requested memory 
            area in bytes. <br></br>
            It returns a pointer of type void which 
            can be cast into a pointer of any form. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            It doesn’t initialize the memory at execution time.<br></br>
            So each block will initially have a default garbage value. 
            
            <br></br><br></br>
<code>
//Example of dynamic memory allocation

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;conio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int *A;
    int i;
    
    /*
    Prototype: void *malloc(size_t size);
    */

    A=(int *)malloc(20*sizeof(int)); 
    // malloc return a void pointer that needs to be converted
    //into a pointer to however the type of the variable that uses it has. 
    //(int *) - is the type of pointer A
    //20 = the number of memory cells allocated;
    
    for (i=0;i&lt;20;i++)
        printf("A[%d]=%d\n", i, A[i]); //the value in each memory cell can be anything
    free(A);
}
</code>
            Calloc function allocates the requested memory and returns a pointer to it similarly to malloc. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>malloc()</code> and <code>calloc()</code> do differentiate in how the functions are used when allocating 
            memory at runtime. <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>malloc()</code> function only returns the starting address, it doesn't zero it.
            <br></br>            
            On the other hand, the <code>calloc()</code> function returns the starting address, zeroing it.
            <br></br>    
<code>
/*Prototype void *calloc(size_t nitems, size_t size)*/

A=(int *)calloc(20, sizeof(int)); 
//calloc does the same as malloc while initializing all elements to 0:
    
for (i=0;i&lt;20;i++)
    printf("A[%d]=%d\n", i ,A[i]); //the value in each memory cell is 0
    
free(A); 
//free is used to free the allocated memory. 
//There is no delete() in C language.
    
</code>

        <serialization>
            Serialization is the process of converting a data object (a combination of code and data 
            represented within a region of data storage) into a series of bytes that saves the state 
            of the object in an easily transmittable form.<br></br><br></br>
        </serialization>
        <deserialization>
            Deserialization is the process of reconstructing a data structure or object from a series 
            of bytes or a string in order to instantiate the object for consumption. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            This is the 
            reverse process of serialization, i.e., converting a data structure or object into a 
            series of bytes for storage or transmission across devices.<br></br>
        </deserialization>
        <enums>
            Enumeration (or <code>enum</code>) is a user defined data type. <br></br>
            It is mainly used to 
            assign names to integral constants, the names make a program easy to read and maintain.
            <br></br><br></br>
        </enums>
        <concurrent-programming>
            Concurrent Programming is a technique in which two or more 
            processes start, run in an interleaved fashion through context switching 
            and complete in an overlapping time period by managing access to 
            shared resources e.g. on a single core of CPU.
            <br></br><br></br>
            This doesn’t necessarily mean that multiple processes will be running 
            at the same instant – even if the results might make it seem like it.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Concurrent Programming can be clasified as asynchronous if it enables operations 
            to be executed without waiting for previous tasks to complete. For instance, if we have 2 processes, 
            one that
            retrieves some information from a server and the other one which sets up an environment where the retrieved 
            information should be displayed, it cannot be considered asynchronous as there is a scenario 
            in which the process
            of setting up the environment is faster than the process of retrieving the information from 
            the server, case in which
            one process has to wait for the other to finish and this would 
            classify it synchronous.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Blocking in asynchronous programming is when a website or browser is no longer able to 
            continue a function and can't perform any tasks until the processor regains control. 
            A frozen web page or application is a typical example of blocking. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Concurrent Programming is an essential technique for design applications 
            that can execute tasks simultaneously, in order to increasing overall 
            efficiency and responsiveness.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Asynchronous programming vs. synchronous programming</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Both asynchronous and synchronous programming involve similar concepts 
            within the broader field of computer programming. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Synchronous or sequential programming is when tasks occur separately 
            or one after another. 
            The program pauses while the system performs the action and only responds once it receives 
            the result. It features a single-thread model, meaning that it only performs a 
            single action at a time.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Asynchronous programming differs in that it allows multiple tasks to run at the same time, 
            and the programmer can often manage these tasks directly. It allows programs to continue to run even after 
            you start a specific action.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Concurency scenarios:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Asynchrony - This means that your program performs non-blocking operations. 
            For example, it can initiate a request for a remote resource via HTTP and then go on to 
            do some other task while it waits for the response to be received. It’s a bit like when 
            you send an email and then go on with your life without waiting for a response.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Parallelism - This means that your program leverages the hardware of multi-core machines 
            to execute 
            tasks at the same time by breaking up work into tasks, each of which is executed on a separate core. 
            It’s a bit like singing in the shower: you’re actually doing two things at exactly the same time.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multithreading - This is a software implementation allowing different threads to be executed 
            concurrently. A multithreaded program appears to be doing several things at the same time even 
            when it’s running on a single-core machine. This is a bit like chatting with different people 
            through various IM windows; although you’re actually switching back and forth, the net result 
            is that you’re having multiple conversations at the same time.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Principles of concurrent Programming:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The are some basic principles and concepts behind concurrent programming: 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Parallelism: Concurrent programs can run multiple processes or 
            threads simultaneously, 
            utilizing multiple processing units available in today's computer systems.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Non-determinism: Due to the unpredictable order of execution, 
            concurrent programs can 
            give different results on different runs, making debugging and testing more complex. 
            This concept arises from the uncertain order in which threads 
            or processes access shared resources and interact with each other.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Synchronization: Concurrent programs use synchronization mechanisms 
            to coordinate access to shared resources and ensure mutually exclusive 
            access or resource protection to prevent data inconsistency and 
            race conditions.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Implementation Techniques:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Concurrent Programming can be implemented through the use of 
            multithreading and multiprocessing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A thread is a single sequence stream within a process.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A stream can be thought of as a path or channel, 
            through which the data is flowing in and out of the program.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Because threads have some of the properties of processes, 
            they are sometimes called lightweight processes.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Threads are not independent from each other unlike processes. 
            As a result, 
            threads share with other threads their code section, 
            data section and OS resources such as: opened files 
            and signals.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Signals are software generated interrupts that are sent to a process 
            when an event happens.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Similar to processes, a thread has its own program 
            counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The program counter (also called "instruction pointer") is 
            part of the hardware; more specifically, it's a processor register. 
            The whole purpose of this register is 
            to point to the current instruction in the memory that is being executed by 
            the processor.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A process is the instance of a computer program that is being 
            executed by 
            one or many threads. By multiprocessing a program can be divided 
            into independent processes, which can run individually as 
            separate programs. This would allow the possibility to offload/distribute 
            these processes on separate cores which would increase performance.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Understanding threading and processing:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A CPU ( also called a central processing unit , main processor, 
            or just processor) is essentially the brain that processes and carries 
            out instructions. 
            <br></br>
            CPUs come in many different varieties, such as 
            single-core, dual-core, 
            quad-core, and other multi-core processors.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Cores are physical processing units. The number of cores 
            in a system will determine how many programs and tasks it can 
            execute simultaneously (in parallel). 
            For instance, a single-core processor may be able to handle one task at a time. 
            By contrast, a quad-core processor could handle up to four 
            simultaneous tasks.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Threads are virtual sequences of instructions given to a CPU. 
            A thread is a sequence of instructions given to the CPU by a program 
            or application. The more threads a CPU can execute at once, the more 
            tasks 
            it can complete.
            Hyperthreading allows multi-core processors to execute two 
            thread concurrently on each core, meaning a 
            quad-core processor could execute up to 8 threads 
            (2 threads on each core).
            <br></br><br></br>
            A thread can be seen as a single-handed person performing one task at 
            a time. 
            Even with one thread
            we can run many programs simultaneous from our perspective, but from CPU's 
            perspective, these tasks are not simultaneous. The CPU has to switch the 
            thread
            between the tasks on every few microseconds, therefore
            moving its hand from doing one thing to doing the other thing so fast that a real person 
            would not be able to notice any difference. <br></br>
            Example: the music doesn't stop playing when 
            writing the keyboard. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            By hyperthreading, the core gets a second hand available, 
            and can perform 
            2 simultaneous tasks but using the same the shared resources of the 
            core, 
            meaning it's slower than doing simultaneous tasks on different cores, 
            but faster than doing single tasks on one core. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multithreading refers to using multiple threads 
            (2 threads) 
            to one core.
            Multithreading allows for better utilization of available system resources by 
            dividing tasks into separate threads and running them in parallel.
            Hyperthreading further increases performance by allowing processors to 
            execute two 
            threads concurrently. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multiprocessing is the utilization of two or more central processing 
            units (CPUs) in achieving one task, meaning we can have 2 cores 
            running same program sharing among themselves data. 
            <br></br>
            Similar to 2 workers working on 
            same task, passing around their tools from one to the other.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Multithreading vs. multiprocessing:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Both multithreading and multiprocessing give birth to few challenges 
            when it comes to concurrent programming.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>The Race Condition:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A race condition occurs when two or more processes/threads 
            can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. 
            As a result, the values of variables 
            may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches 
            of the processes/threads.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Process/Thread Syncronization:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Process Synchronization and Thread Synchronization 
            are two mechanism defined for concurrent programming in order to ensure 
            that two or more concurrent processes/threads do not simultaneously execute 
            some particular program segment known as critical section.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A critical section refers to the parts of the 
            program where the shared resources are being accessed by different 
            threads/processes. So the 2 workers or the 2 hands 
            working on the same task collide to each other.
            <br></br><br></br>
            By using Process Synchronization and Thread Synchronization 
            the race condition can be avoided.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Both multithreading and multiprocessing can be used to 
            increase the computing power of a system, but there are some key differences between 
            these two approaches. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>
            Differences between Multithreading and Multiprocessing:
            </brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multiprocessing uses two or more CPUs to increase computing power, 
            whereas 
            multithreading uses a single process with multiple 
            code segments to increase computing power.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multithreading focuses on generating computing threads from a 
            single process, 
            whereas multiprocessing increases computing power by adding 
            CPUs. Meaning via multiprocessing we can distribute proccesses on 
            separate CPUs, whereas this is not possible with multithreading.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multiprocessing is used to create a more reliable system, whereas 
            multithreading is used to create threads that run parallel to each other.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multithreading is quick to create and requires few resources, 
            whereas multiprocessing 
            requires a significant amount of time and specific resources for its creation.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multiprocessing executes many processes simultaneously, 
            whereas multithreading executes many threads simultaneously.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multithreading uses a common address space for all 
            the threads, whereas 
            multiprocessing 
            creates a separate address space for each process.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In multiprocessing each process has its own memory 
            address space (stack memory). So when returning a value
            from a process, the value returned will not be 
            seen by the rest of the program unless it is saved in a file, in a 
            shared memory address, or in a message pipe, 
            whereas multithreading is able to return values which can be used 
            later in the main program.
            <br></br>
            A pipe is a technique for passing information from one program process 
            to another.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A process is treated as an individual program, (it even creates a 
            process in the Task Manager).
            Processes can be sent through different cores, that would speed 
            up the program even more.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Creating multiple processes is costly compare to threads. 
            Since for each process there is allocated another stack memory 
            space.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multithreading is recommended for IO (input/output) operations such as: 
            file inputting/outputting and http requests, whereas 
            multiprocessing is recommended for CPU intensive operations 
            such as: calculations.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Advantages of multithreading:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            1. It requires less memory storage.<br></br>
            2. Accessing memory is easier since threads share the same 
            parent process.<br></br>
            3. Switching between threads is fast and efficient.<br></br>
            4. It's faster to generate new threads within an existing process 
            than to create 
            an entirely new process.<br></br>
            5. All threads share one process memory pool  and the same 
            address space.<br></br>
            6. Threads are more lightweight and have lower overhead. 
            Any combination of excess or indirect computation time, memory, bandwidth, or other 
            resources that are required to perform a specific task is refered to as 
            overhead.
            <br></br> 
            7. The cost of communication between threads is relatively low.
            Meaning that threads can communicate with each other more easily 
            than processes can.
            <br></br>
            8. Creating responsive user interactions (UIs) is easy.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Disadvantages of multithreading:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            1. A multithreading system cannot be interrupted/killed. Special attention has to
            be paid to memory leaks.
            A memory leak occurs when programmers allocate memory on 
            the heap and forget to deallocate it.<br></br>
            2. The code can be more challenging to understand.<br></br>
            3. The overhead associated with managing different 
            threads may be too costly for basic tasks.<br></br>
            4. Increased potential for race conditions. 
            <br></br>
            5. Debugging and troubleshooting issues may become more 
            challenging because the code can be complex.
            <br></br><br></br><br></br>
            <green>Advantages of multiprocessing:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            1. It uses simple coding that's easy to understand.<br></br>
            2. Child processes can be interrupted.<br></br>
            3. It completes tasks faster and analyzes large amounts of data.<br></br>
            4. It uses multiple CPUs to improve a system's overall processing power.<br></br>
            5. It removes synchronization primitives.<br></br>
            6. It's more cost-effective than single processor systems.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Disadvantages of multiprocessing:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            1. It requires more memory storage and overhead than threads 
            in order to move data between the processes.<br></br>
            2. Spawning processes take longer than spawning threads.<br></br>
            3. An inter-process communication (IPC) model must be implemented to 
            share objects between the processes.<br></br>
            4. The entire memory is copied into each subprocess, which can also create more 
            overhead.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Choosing between multithreading and multiprocessing:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            1. Multithreading can proove optimal for make user interaction (UI) 
            programs responsive.
            <br></br>
            These programs have to wait for the user to interact with them, so using threads 
            provides enough computing power. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            For instance: Multithreading can proove optimal for creating an 
            online writing 
            program in which one thread could track the user's keystrokes, 
            a second thread could display the text for the user to read and a third 
            thread could check the inputted text to identify spelling and grammar errors.
            <br></br><br></br>
            2. Multithreading can proove optimal for creating I/O-bound or network-bound 
            applications.
            <br></br>
            Threads can provide all the computing power needed to access web servers 
            and download content from the internet. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            For instance: many data scientists use multithreading to create web 
            scraping applications.
            <br></br><br></br>
            3. Multiprocessing can proove optimal for creating computation-intensive 
            programs.
            <br></br>
            Multiprocessing can help analyzing large volumes of data quickly.
            <br></br><br></br>
            4. Multiprocessing can proove optimal for develop programs that 
            are CPU intensive.
            <br></br>
            Multiprocessing can help to speed up processes and provide 
            reliable solutions for programs that involve several CPU tasks.

        </concurrent-programming>
        <bitwise-operators>
            The <code>&#38;</code> (bitwise AND) in C takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit 
            of two numbers. <br></br>
            The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.  
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>|</code> (bitwise OR) in C takes two numbers as operands and does 
            OR on every bit 
            of two numbers. <br></br>
            The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>^</code> (bitwise XOR) takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every 
            bit of two numbers.<br></br> 
            The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> (left-shift) takes two numbers, left-shifts the bits of the 
            first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (right-shift) takes two numbers, right-shifts the bits of the 
            first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>~</code> (bitwise NOT) takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            The left-shift and right-shift operators should not be used for 
            negative numbers.<br></br>
            The left-shift and right-shift operators are equivalent to 
            multiplication and division by 
            2 respectively.<br></br><br></br>
            
            
            The bitwise OR of two numbers is just the sum of those two numbers if there is no carry 
            involved, otherwise, you just add their bitwise AND.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            Let’s say, we have <code>a=5(101)</code> and <code>b=2(010)</code>, since there is no carry involved, 
            their sum is just <code>a|b</code>. <br></br>
            Now, if we change 'a' to 6 which is 110 in binary, their sum would change 
            to <code>a|b + a&#38;b</code> since there is a carry involved.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The bitwise XOR operator is the most useful operator from a technical interview perspective.
            <br></br><br></br>
            It is used in many problems. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            
            The <code>&#38;</code> operator can be used to quickly check if a number is odd or even.<br></br>

            The value of the expression <code>(x &#38; 1)</code> would be non-zero only if x is odd, otherwise, 
            the value would be zero. <br></br><br></br>
            
            The <code>~</code> operator should be used carefully.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The result of the <code>~</code> operator on a small number can be a big number if the result 
            is stored in an unsigned variable. <br></br><br></br>
            
            The result may be a negative number if the result 
            is stored in a signed variable (assuming that the negative numbers are stored into a
            complement form where the leftmost bit is the sign bit).<br></br>

        <command-line-arguments>
            Command-line arguments are passed to the main function 
            as (<code>argc</code>, <code>argv</code>), or (<code>args</code>). 
            <br></br>
            Command-line arguments are used to control the program from 
            the outside.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>For C/C++:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In languages such as C and C++ both <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> are being 
            used for this purpose as follows:
            <br></br><br></br>
            The name of the program is 
            stored in <code>argv[0]</code>, the first command-line parameter in <code>argv[1]</code>, 
            and the    last argument in <code>argv[n]</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>argc</code> - argument count is an integer variable that stores
            the number of command-line 
            arguments passed by the user including the name of the program. 
            So if we pass a 
            value to a program, the value of <code>argc</code> would be 2 
            (one for argument and one for 
            program name). 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The value of argc should be non-negative.
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>argv</code> - argument vector is an array of character pointers 
            listing all the arguments.
            If <code>argc</code> is greater than zero, the array elements from <code>argv[0]</code> 
            to <code>argv[argc-1]</code> will 
            contain pointers to strings.<br></br><br></br>
            <code>argv[0]</code> is the name of the program. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            After that until <code>argv[argc-1]</code> every element 
            is a command-line argument.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Properties of command-line arguments in C/C++:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            <code>argv[argc]</code> is a NULL pointer.<br></br>
            <code>argv[0]</code> holds the name of the program.<br></br>
            <code>argv[1]</code> points to the first command-line argument and <code>argv[argc-1]</code> points to 
                the last argument.
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>For Java/C#:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In programming languages such as: C# and Java, only one variable is used to 
            store the command-line arguments: <code>args</code>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In these languages <code>args</code> is declared as an array of 
            string 
            elements. The length of the <code>args</code> can be obtained by using the OOP 
            attributes of the string
            class defined in those languages: <code>args.length</code> (in Java) 
            or <code>args.Length</code> (in C#).

            They are parameters/arguments supplied to the program when it is invoked.<br></br>
            They are used to control programs from outside instead of hard coding those values

        <modular-programming>
            Modular programming consists of separating implementation from interface and 
            hiding information in the implementation.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Advantages of modular programming:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>Code is easier to read:</indigo><br></br>
            Working on modular programming makes code easier 
            to read 
            because functions perform different tasks as compared to monolithic codes. 
            Sometimes modular programming can be a bit messy if we pass arguments and 
            variables in different functions. 
            The use of modules should be done in a 
            sensible manner so as to avoid any problem. <br></br>
            Functions should be neat, clean, 
            and descriptive.<br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>Code is easier to test:</indigo><br></br>
            In software, some functions perform fewer tasks than
            other functions. If the software is easily split 
            using modules, it becomes easier to test. <br></br>
            We can also focus on the riskier 
            functions during testing and use more test cases to make it bug-free.<br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>Reusability:</indigo><br></br>  
            There are times where a piece of code is implemented 
            everywhere in 
            our program. Instead of copying and pasting it, again and again, modularity 
            gives us the advantage of reusability so that we can pull our code from 
            anywhere using interfaces or libraries. <br></br>
            The concept of reusability also 
            reduces the size of our program.<br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>Faster fixes:</indigo><br></br>            
            Suppose there is an error in the payment options in any 
            application, and the bug needs to be removed. Modularity can be a great help 
            because we know that there will be a separate function that will contain the 
            code of payments, and only that function will only be rectified.<br></br>
            Using modules to find and fix bugs becomes much more 
            smooth and maintainable.<br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>Low-risk update:</indigo><br></br>
            In modular programming, a defined layer of APIs protects 
            things that 
            use it from making changes inside the library. Unless there is a change in the API, 
            there is a low risk for someone's code-breaking. <br></br>
                        For example, if you didn't have 
            explicit APIs and someone changed a function they thought was only used within that 
            same library (but it was used elsewhere), they could accidentally break 
            something.<br></br><br></br>
            
            
            <indigo>Easy collaboration:</indigo><br></br>
            
            Different developers work on a single piece of code in the team. 
            There are chances of conflicts when there's a git merge. 
            This conflict can be reduced 
            if the code is split between more functions, files, repos, 
            etc. <br></br>
            We can also provide 
            ownership to specific code modules, where a team member can break them down into 
            smaller tasks.<br></br><br></br>
            
            <green>Disadvantages of modular programming:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>Requires more resources:</indigo><br></br>
            There is a need for extra time and 
            budget for a product in modular programming.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>Increases the risk and the difficulty:</indigo><br></br>
            It is a challenging task to 
            combine and integrate all the modules into a single program.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>Additional efforts needed for the design:</indigo><br></br> 
            The design should be carefully defined 
            so that the impact for the other program modules is minimum.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>The task repetition impacts the software performance:</indigo><br></br>
            Some modules may partly 
            repeat the task 
            performed by other modules. Hence, modular programs may need more memory, 
            space and extra time for execution.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>The work efficiency might be impacted:</indigo><br></br>
            It reduces the program's 
            efficiency because testing and debugging are 
            time-consuming, where each function contains a thousand lines of code.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            <indigo>The code readability might be affected:</indigo><br></br>
            Integrating various modules into a 
            single program might prove be a difficult task because 
            different people working on the design of different modules may not have the 
            same style.

        <datatype-conversions>
            <green>Generally there are two types of conversions:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            - implicit conversion (done automatically by the compiler)<br></br>
            - explicit conversion (done manually by the developer)<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
            Implicit conversion is done automatically by the compiler when you assign a value 
            of one type to another.<br></br><br></br>
            Explicit conversion is done manually by placing the type in parentheses <code>()</code> in front 
            of the value. Also knows as typecasting. 
            <br></br>
        </datatype-conversions>
        <operators>
            An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or 
            logical functions. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            By definition, an operator performs a certain operation on 
            operands. 
            <br></br>
            An operator needs one or more operands for the operation to be performed.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Depending on how many operands are required to perform the operation, operands are called as 
            unary, binary or ternary operators.
            They need one, two or three operands respectively.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Unary operators − <code>++</code> (increment), <code>--</code> (decrement), <code>!</code> (NOT), <code>~</code> (compliment), <code>&#38;</code> (address of), <code>*</code> (dereference)
            <br></br><br></br>
            Binary operators − arithmetic, logical and relational operators except <code>!</code>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Ternary operators − The <code>?</code> operator.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Most programming languages are rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>

                <code>−</code> it subtracts second operand from the first.<br></br>
                <code>A − B = -10</code><br></br>

                <code>++</code> is the Increment operator. <br></br>
                It increases the integer value by one.<br></br>

        <constructors>
            A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object 
            of a <code>class</code> is created.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Constructors can also take parameters (just like 
            regular functions), which can be useful for setting initial 
            values for attributes.<br></br>
        </constructors>
        <instantiation>
            In object-oriented programming, an instance is a concrete realization 
            of a class. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            When you define a <code>class</code>, you're essentially creating a blueprint. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            An instance is an object built from that blueprint. <br></br>
            It has all the characteristics defined in the <code>class</code>, but with specific values.
            <br></br>
        </instantiation>
        <destructors>
            Destructor is an instance member function that is invoked automatically whenever an object is 
            going to be destroyed. <br></br><br></br>
            The destructor is the last function that is going to be called before an 
            object is destroyed.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>About destructors:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            - A destructor is also a special member function like a constructor. <br></br>
            - Destructor destroys the class objects created by the constructor. <br></br>
            - Destructor has the same name as their <code>class</code> name preceded by a 
            tilde (<code>~</code>) symbol.<br></br>
            - It is not possible to define more than one destructor. <br></br>
            - The destructor is the only one way to destroy the object created by the constructor. 
            <br></br>
            - The destructor can-not be overloaded.
            <br></br>
            - Destructor neither requires any argument nor returns any value.<br></br>
            - It is automatically called when an object goes out of scope. <br></br>
            - Destructor release memory space occupied by the objects created by the constructor.<br></br>
            - In destructor, objects are destroyed in the reverse of an object creation.<br></br>
            
        </destructors>
        <function-overloading>
            Function overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming 
            where two or more 
            functions can have the same name but different parameters. <br></br><br></br>
            Function overloading can be considered as an example of a polymorphism 
            feature.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multiple functions having same name but different parameters is 
            known as function overloading.<br></br>
            If we have to perform one operation then having same name for the functions 
            doing it increases 
            the readability of the program.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Function Overloading vs. Function Overriding:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Function/Method overloading refers to defining multiple functions/methods 
            with the same name but different parameters within the same class, 
            while function/method overriding involves 
            creating a function/method in the child class that has the same name, 
            parameters, and 
            return type as a function/method in the parent class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>
            Overloaded functions can be defined both outside and inside classes.
            </brown><br></br>
        </function-overloading>
        <operator-overloading>
            Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism. <br></br><br></br>
            It is an idea of giving special meaning to an existing operator 
            without changing its original meaning. <br></br>
        </operator-overloading>
        <namespaces>
            A namespace is a feature which can be defined as a
            declarative region that provides a scope to the 
            identifiers (names of functions, 
            variables or other user-defined data types) inside it. 
            <br></br>
        </namespaces>
        <exception-handling>
            In computer programming exceptions are runtime anomalies or abnormal conditions that a program 
            encounters during its execution. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The process of handling these exceptions is 
            called exception handling. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Using the exception handling mechanism, the control 
            from one part of the program where the exception occurred can be transferred 
            to another part of the code.
            <br></br><br></br>
            By using exception handling we can handle the anomalies so that our 
            program keeps running.<br></br>
        </exception-handling>
        <default-parameters>
            A default parameter/argument is a value provided in a function declaration that is 
            automatically assigned by the compiler if the calling function doesn’t provide 
            a value for the argument. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In case any value is passed, the default value is 
            overridden. <br></br>
        </default-parameters>
        <interfaces>
            In programming: an interface describes the behavior or capabilities of a class without 
            committing to a particular implementation of that class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The interfaces are implemented using abstract classes and these abstract classes
            should not be confused with data abstraction which is a concept of keeping 
            implementation details separate from associated data.<br></br>
        </interfaces>
        <abstract-classes>
            The purpose of an abstract class (often referred to as an ABC) is to provide an 
            appropriate base class from which other classes can inherit. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects and serves only as an 
            interface. <br></br>
            Attempting to instantiate an object of an abstract class causes a 
            compilation error. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            If a subclass of an ABC needs to be instantiated, it has to implement each of 
            the virtual/abstract functions, which means that it supports the 
            interface declared by the 
            ABC. <br></br><br></br>
            Failing to override a pure virtual/abstract function in a 
            derived class, 
            then attempting to instantiate objects of that <code>class</code>, is a compilation error.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An object-oriented system might use an abstract base class to provide a common and 
            standardized interface appropriate for all the external applications. <br></br>
            Through inheritance from the abstract base class, derived classes are 
            formed that operate similarly.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The capabilities (i.e., the public functions) offered by the external applications 
            are provided as pure virtual/abstract functions in the abstract base class. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The implementations of these pure virtual/abstract functions are provided in 
            the derived 
            classes that correspond to the specific types of the application.<br></br>
        </abstract-classes>
        <optional-parameters>
            A parameter with a default value, is often known as an "optional parameter".

            For more information see the default-parameters section.
        </optional-parameters>
        <decorators>
            Decorator is a structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects 
            dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects , called decorators. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Using decorators you can wrap objects  countless number of times since both target 
            objects  and decorators follow the same interface.<br></br>
        </decorators>
        <generic-programming>
            Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which 
            algorithms are 
            written in terms of data types to-be-specified-later that are then instantiated 
            when needed for specific types provided as parameters.
            <br></br><br></br>            
            The functions and classes which are data type independent 
            are called generics, 
            and this concept is called generic programming. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>
            Generic Programming provides efficiency by reducing code 
            repetition and in-demand compilation.

        <abstraction>
            Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the 
            details. <br></br><br></br>
            Abstraction is a powerful technique that allows for a separation of 
            concerns between the 
            interface and implementation of a <code>class</code>. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            It helps to reduce complexity and improve 
            maintainability by allowing changes to be made to the 
            implementation without affecting 
            the overall behavior of the <code>class</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Can be used to create a base implementation or contract for the 
            actual implementation from base classes.

            <green>Types of Abstraction in OOP:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Data abstraction:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of 
            object-oriented programming. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information 
            about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Using data abstraction, we are not allowed to access the variables directly, however, 
            one can call the setter function to set the values or the 
            getter function to get the values.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            Advantages of Data Abstraction:
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            Helps the user to avoid writing the low-level code;<br></br>
            Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.<br></br>
            Can change the internal implementation of the <code>class</code> independently 
            without affecting the user.
            <br></br>
            Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important 
            details are provided to the user.<br></br>
            It reduces the complexity as well as the redundancy of the code, therefore 
            increasing the readability.
            
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Process Abstraction:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Process abstraction focuses on abstracting the behavior or 
            processes of an object. 
            <br></br>
            It allows developers to define the methods an object that can perform without 
            specifying how these methods are implemented. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Process abstraction is achieved through interfaces. 
            <br></br>
            Interfaces define a set of method signatures without providing the method 
            implementations, enabling multiple classes to implement the same 
            interface in different ways.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Abstraction vs. Concrete Implementation:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Abstraction provides a clear distinction between the interface 
            of an object and its internal implementation. 
            This separation enables developers to focus on 
            high-level design and promotes code reusability.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Concrete implementation, 
            on the other hand, involves the actual coding and realization of the abstract 
            concepts. Striking a balance between abstraction and concrete 
            implementation is 
            essential in creating maintainable, scalable, and 
            efficient software systems.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Abstraction is one of the 4 OOP fundamental concepts, 
            and it is regarded to abstract objects, which are the objects 
            that contain fields and methods to be inherited by their children. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            An abstract object is like a dead parent
            which has to allow inheritance to their children and nothing more.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Abstraction is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.
            <br></br><br></br>
            For example, when you consider the case of e-mail, complex details such as what happens 
            as soon as you send an e-mail, the protocol your e-mail, server uses, are hidden from 
            the user. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Therefore, to send an e-mail you just need to type the content, mention the 
            address of the receiver, and click send.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Similarly, in object-oriented programming, abstraction is a process of 
            hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be 
            provided to the user. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does 
            instead of how it does it.
            <br></br>
        </abstraction>
        <variable-arguments-lists>
            In programming: A function that takes a variable number of arguments 
            is called a 
            variadic function. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A variadic function must specify at least one fixed argument 
            with an explicitly declared data type. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Additional arguments can follow, and can vary in 
            both quantity and data type.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The variable number of arguments permits a function to 
            accept any number of arguments.

        </variable-arguments-lists>
        <random-generators>
            A random number generator forms the backbone of creating pseudo-random numbers.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The idea behind pseudo-random numbers is that a computer does not have a thinking 
            process to select a random number. <br></br><br></br>
            So even though an output number produced may seem random, the values are 
            mathematically computed.
        </random-generators>
        <preprocessor-directives>
            Preprocessor directives are lines of the source file where the first non-whitespace 
            character is <code>#</code> , which distinguishes them from other lines of text. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The effect of each preprocessor directives is a change to the text and the 
            result is a 
            transformation of the text that does not contain the directives nor comments.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>The #define preprocessor as example:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>#define</code> preprocessor directive creates symbolic constant. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The symbolic constant is called a macro and the general form of the 
            directive is:<br></br>
<code>
#define macro-name replacement-text

        <collections>
            In computer programming: A collection is an object that groups 
            multiple elements into a single unit.
            <br></br><br></br> 
            Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate 
            aggregate data.
            <br></br>
        </collections>
        <read-from-file>
            File handling is the process in which we create, open, 
            read, write, and close operations on a file.
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            A file is a collection of data stored in the secondary memory. 
            <br></br><br></br> 
            The data is entered into the programs through the keyboard. 
            <br></br><br></br> 
            Files are used for storing information that can be processed 
            by the programs. 
            <br></br><br></br> 
            Files are not only used for storing the data, programs are also 
            stored in files.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Features of file handling:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Reusability:</indigo><br></br>
            The data stored in the file can be accessed, 
            updated, and deleted anywhere and anytime providing  
            high reusability.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Portability:</indigo><br></br>
            Without losing any data, files can be transferred to 
            another in the computer system. The risk of flawed coding is 
            minimized with this feature.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Efficiency:</indigo><br></br>
            A large amount of input may be required for some programs. 
            File handling allows you to easily access a part of a file using few 
            instructions which saves a lot of time and reduces the chance of errors.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Storage Capacity:</indigo><br></br>
            Files allow you to store a large amount of data 
            without having to worry about storing everything simultaneously in a program.
            <br></br><br></br>
        </read-from-file>
        <write-to-file>
            When a program is terminated, the entire data is lost.
            <br></br><br></br>  
            Storing in a file will preserve your data even if the 
            program terminates.
            <br></br><br></br>  
            A file is a container in computer storage devices used for storing 
            data.
            <br></br> 
        </write-to-file>
        <inheritance>
            Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built 
            upon existing 
            classes, to specify a new implementation  while maintaining the 
            same behaviors
            (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend 
            original software via <code>public classes</code> and <code>interfaces</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Inheritance consist in classes that can inherit other classes 
            behaviour and functionality.

            Example: A class that inherits from another class 
            can have access to its variables and methods as if it were its own.

        <recursion>
            Recursion is a programming concept available to all programming languages.
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            Recursion is achieved by using recursive functions.
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            A recursive function is a function that calls itself.
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            Recursion is a concept where the solution to a problem depends on 
            solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration).
            <br></br> 
            
            Example: <code>5! = (4!*5) = (3! * 4 * 5) = (2! *3 *4 *5)</code> etc.
            
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            A recursive function needs to have a condition or 
            exit statement in order to stop the recursion and to avoid infinite looping 
            and stack overflow.
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            <green>Stack overflow:</green>
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            Stack overflow is a type of buffer overflow error 
            which occurs when the stack memory gets exhausted and the computer program 
            still tries to use more memory space. 
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            All local variables are stored in the stack memory. 
            Every function has it's own stack, once the function ends 
            the stack is empties and everything stored is lost 
            (local variables die).
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            The overall stack memory allocated by the program is only few megabytes. 
            That's why in some programming languages we need to make use of 
            dynamic memory allocation. 
            <br></br> <br></br> 
            Dynamic memory allocation allows using the rest of the RAM memory, 
            and enables 
            using global variables, or variables stored in heap 
            (variables that don't die).
            These variables live through the lifetime of the program or can be 
            deallocated
            when no longer needed. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>
                Recursion vs Loops:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Using the loop: the code is easier to read and understand 
            (reading code is always a lot harder than writing it), and loops are 
            generally faster.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Recursion is useful when it is the natural way of viewing the problem, 
            but you must be sure that there is a manageable number of stack frames 
            involved. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A stack frame is a block of memory assigned to the stack 
            when a function is called, if the stack frames exceeds the 
            stack memory capacity, the stack overflow error will occur 
            and will terminate the program.
            <br></br>
       </recursion>
        <string-methods>
            A string is a variable that holds a sequence of 
            one or more alphanumeric characters.
            <br></br><br></br> 
            It is usually possible to manipulate a string to provide information or 
            to alter the contents of a string using methods.

        <reflection>
            Reflective programming or reflection is a mechanism that 
            enables a process perform 
            introspective operations, examine and modify its 
            own structure and behavior.
            <br></br>
            The reflection APIs built into programming languages allows
            developers to inspect code at runtime.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Reflection is used to obtain information about the software implementation 
            (the metadata), while it is in runtime. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Also reflection is the ability of inspecting the code's metadata 
            in runtime.
            The metadata is related to the implementation, contains the 
            information about the fields, methods, properties, 
            variable, etc. used inside the software.
        </reflection>
        <functions>
            In computer programming: a function is a block of organized, reusable code that 
            is used to perform a single, related action.
            Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree 
            of code reusing.
            Functions can be defined with parameters, these are local variables whose scope
            is on function level. Once the function ends, the variables die, and all the data
            stored in them is lost, so if everything should be kept alive, it has to be returned
            back to the caller function and stored.

        <description>
            C is a general-purpose computer programming language.<br></br><br></br>
            It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and 
            influential. <br></br><br></br>
            By design, C's features cleanly reflect the 
            capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating 
            systems, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application 
            software has been decreasing. <br></br><br></br>
            C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest 
            supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers 
            and embedded systems.

            In C Language generic programming can be achieved using:

            <code>Arrays</code> are collections of elements of the same data type with fixed size. 
            <br></br>
            Once the array is defined, its size cannot be changed.
            <br></br><br></br>

<code>
/*Declaring arrays and initializing arrays*/

            The <code>linked list</code> is a complex data type, which consists of a structure with 
            at least 2 elements: value and pointer
            to the next element. <br></br>
            The memory can be allocated dynamically for each element added to the list. 
            <br></br><br></br>

            The main benefit of a <code>linked list</code>
            consists in the possibility of adding a variable number of elements, being able to 
            delete or add an element 
            without making copies
            or exchanges, but only by changing the addresses of the assigned pointers for 
            the next / previous element.

            The <code>w</code> mode means that the file is opened for writing.

            To insert content to it, you can

            If you write to a file that already exists, the old content is deleted, and the new content 
            is inserted. 
            <br></br>
            This is important to know, as you might accidentally erase existing content.

        </green>
        <br></br><br></br>
        It is considered as good practice, because it makes sure that:
        <br></br><br></br>
        
        Changes are saved properly. <br></br>
        Other programs can use the file (if you want). <br></br>
        Clean up unnecessary memory space. <br></br><br></br>
        
        If you want to add content to a file without deleting the old content, 
        you can use the <code>a</code> mode. <br></br>
        The <code>a</code> mode appends content at the end of the file:<br></br>
        
<code>
/*Example*/

FILE *fptr;

// Open a file in append mode
fptr = fopen("filename.txt", "a"); 

/*Just like with the w mode; if the file does not exist, 
the a mode will create a new file with the "appended" content.*/

// Append some text to the file
fprintf(fptr, "\nHi everybody!");

// Close the file
fclose(fptr);
</code>

            *General-Programming-Knowledge*
            C and C++ do not provide serialization as any sort of high-level construct, 
            but both languages support writing any of the built-in data types, as well as 
            plain old data structs, as binary data. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            As such, it is usually trivial to write custom serialization functions.

            C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language 
            created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. <br></br><br></br>
            First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, 
            it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, 
            generic, and functional features. <br></br>
            In addition to facilities for low-level memory 
            manipulation for making things like microcomputers or to make operating systems 
            like Linux or Windows. <br></br><br></br>
            
            It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, 
            and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, 
            LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.

/*

The word polymorphism means having many forms. 

Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes 
and they are related by inheritance.

C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a 
different function to be executed depending on the type of object 
that invokes the function. 

Example: if a parent class function is set to be overridable, 
then a parent class pointer can have functionality of the 
child class object.

A pure virtual function is a function that is declared in 
the parent class and it should be defined in every child classes.

Syntax: virtual void DisplayFunction () = 0;

            Functions with a variable number of arguments in C++ can be easily implemented using 
            a vector or an array if all the arguments are the same type.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If all arguments are of different types, then we need to use the <code>cstdarg</code> header file 
            to implement variadic functions.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Variadic functions do not put restrictions on the types of arguments. <br></br>
            They also do not perform integer and floating-point enhancements.

            All variables use data type during declaration to restrict the type of data to 
            be stored. <br></br>
            Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables 
            the type of data they can store. <br></br><br></br>
            Whenever a variable is defined in C++, 
            the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type 
            with which it is declared. <br></br><br></br>

            C++ integrates the operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> for allocating dynamic memory.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Operators <code>new</code> and <code>new[]</code>: 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Dynamic memory is allocated using operator <code>new</code>. <br></br>
            <code>new</code> is followed by a data 
            type specifier and, if a sequence of more than one element is required, 
            the number of these within brackets <code>[]</code>. <br></br>
            It returns a pointer to the beginning of the new block of memory allocated. <br></br>
<code>
//Example:

int * foo;
foo = new int [5];
</code>
        In this case, the system dynamically allocates space for five elements of type <code>int</code> 
        and returns a pointer to the first element of the sequence, which is assigned to 
        <code>foo</code> (a pointer). <br></br><br></br>
        Therefore, <code>foo</code> now points to a valid block of memory with space 
        for five elements of type <code>int</code>.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Operators <code>delete</code> and <code>delete[]</code>: 
        <br></br><br></br>
        In most cases, memory allocated dynamically is only needed during specific periods 
        of time within a program; once it is no longer needed, it can be freed so that 
        the memory becomes available again for other requests of dynamic memory. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        This is the purpose of operator <code>delete</code>, whose syntax is: <br></br>
<code>
// Example of dynamic allocation
// and deallocation of memory using new and delete

#include &lt;iostream&gt; 
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Pointer initialization to null
    int* p = NULL;

    // Request memory for the variable
    // using new operator
    p = new (nothrow) int;
    if (!p)
        cout &lt;&lt; "allocation of memory failed\n";
    else {
        // Store value at allocated address
        *p = 29;
        cout &lt;&lt; "Value of p: " &lt;&lt; *p &lt;&lt; endl;
    }

    // Request block of memory
    // using new operator
    float* r = new float(75.25);

    cout &lt;&lt; "Value of r: " &lt;&lt; *r &lt;&lt; endl;

    // Request block of memory of size n
    int n = 5;
    int* q = new (nothrow) int[n];

    if (!q)
        cout &lt;&lt; "allocation of memory failed\n";
    else {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
            q[i] = i + 1;

        cout &lt;&lt; "Value store in block of memory: ";
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
            cout &lt;&lt; q[i] &lt;&lt; " ";
    }

    // freed the allocated memory
    delete p;
    delete r;

    // freed the block of allocated memory
    delete[] q;

    return 0;

            The <code>fstream</code> library can be used in C++ to work with files.
            <br></br><br></br>
            There are three classes included in the <code>fstream</code> library, 
            which are used to create, write or read files:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Class description:</green><br></br><br></br>
            <code>ofstream</code> - Creates and writes to files.<br></br>
            <code>ifstream</code> - Reads from files.<br></br>
            <code>fstream</code>  - A combination of <code>ofstream</code> and <code>ifstream</code>: 
            creates, reads, and writes to files.
            <br></br><br></br>
            To read from a file, use either the <code>ifstream</code> or <code>fstream class</code>, and the name of the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Note: we also use a <code>while</code> loop together with the <code>getline()</code> function 
            (which belongs to the <code>ifstream</code> class) to read the file line by line, and to print 
            the content of the file:
            <br></br>
<code>
// Create a text string, which is used to output the text file

#include &lt;iostream&gt; 
#include &lt;fstream&gt; 

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    string myText;

    // Read from the text file
    ifstream MyReadFile("filename.txt");

    // Use a while loop together with the getline() 
    //to read the file line by line
    while (getline (MyReadFile, myText)) 
    {
      // Output the text from the file
      cout &lt;&lt; myText;
    }

    // Close the file
    MyReadFile.close(); 
    //It is considered good practice to close the file, 
    //and it can clean up unnecessary memory space.

            creates, reads, and writes to files.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Create and Write To a File:
            <br></br><br></br>
            To create a file, use either the <code>ofstream</code> or <code>fstream class</code>, and specify 
            the name of the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            To write to the file, use the insertion operator (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>).<br></br>

            <br></br><br></br>
            In C, an enum is basically a way to alias names to integers. 
            This does not lead to 
            improved type checking. <br></br>
            In C++, an enum defines an actual type, which results in 
            strong type checking.<br></br>
<code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt; 
#include &lt;conio.h&gt; 

using namespace std;

/*
While processing a game loop, there are lots of statements to be checked, 
so in order to use those statements, 
variables that will hold a certain value will be created. 

Example:
int GamePlay =1;
int PauseGame = 2;
int ExitGame = 3;

So in this way the statements can be checked, 
to see when the game should be paused, should run, or should exit. 
As you see above, the variables that are used needs to have different values.

An enum is a way to enclose a bunch of constants, 
An enum guarantees that every variable inside it, will have different values.

Example: an enum with the variables above, can be created as follows:
enum GameStates {GamePlay, PauseGame, ExitGame};

So the synthax is:
enum &lt;name&gt; {states/members};
*/

//Creating a GLOBAL enum:
enum GameStates {GamePlay, PauseGame, ExitGame}; 
//the elements will take as constant value the position inside the enum;
//In this case: GamePlay = 0; PauseGame=1; ExitGame=2;

/*

enum members cannot be initialized with values: 
Example GamePlay = 5, this will give compilation error.

Instead the enum can be initialized only as follows:
GameStates=ExitGame;

In this case the active value of the enum will be ExitGame;
The syntax is : &lt;enum name&gt; = &lt;enum member&gt;;

An enum class is an enum that will use the scope resolution and 
an object of the enum class for assignments as above.

Example:
GameStates gameStates=GameStates::ExitGame;

An enum class will make possible that you can have multiple 
enums with the same members. 

So we could have for example:
enum class GameState {Exit, MainMenu};
enum class SoftwareState (Exit, MainMenu);

Without using an enum class this could not be possible because, 
the 2 members will conflict to each other
(compilation error).

Syntax to create an enum class:

enum class &lt;name&gt; { member1, member2...}
An enum cannot be forward declared, unless it's an enum class. 
So only enum classes can be forward declared.

To change the default value of an ENUM Member which consist in it's position 
on the enum, you can do as follows:

enum GameState {MainMenu=5, GamePlay=7, GameExit, GamePaused}; 
//the two uninitialized members follow gets the value of the
previous member+1; so GameExit will be 8, GamePause will be 9;

*/

int main()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "GamePlay value: " &lt;&lt; GamePlay &lt;&lt; endl; // this is 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; "PauseGame value: " &lt;&lt; PauseGame &lt;&lt; endl; // this is 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; "ExitGame value: " &lt;&lt; ExitGame &lt;&lt; endl; // this is 2;
    getch();
    return 0;

        <description>
            C# is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple 
            paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, 
            lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, 
            functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), 
            and component-oriented programming disciplines. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 
            2000. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of 
            which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, 
            providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# 
            programming language. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), 
            Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), 
            all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and 
            cross-platform. 
            Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.<br></br><br></br>

            *General-Programming-Knowledge*
            <br></br>
            In C# for an inherited class can be only one parent class 
            (only single class inheritance is allowed).
            <br></br><br></br> 
            In case of inherited classes: the parent class constructor gets automatically 
            executed before the child class constructor if the parent class constructor 
            has no arguments.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Otherwise: if the parent class has a constructors with multiple 
            arguments/parameters 
            it must be specified at the child class constructor declaration a 
            syntax<code>:base()</code>
            and specify the arguments of the constructor that you want to 
            be executed inside 
            the pharanteses.

            To prevent a <code>class</code> of having children (inheritance), you can use the

            A <code>sealed class</code> cannot have children (cannot be <code>base class</code>).

            <green>C# brings changes with regards to the datatypes which were available in C/C++:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            C# supports pointers in a limited extent. <br></br><br></br>
            A C# pointer is 
            nothing but a variable that 
            holds the memory address of another type. But in C# pointer can only be declared to 
            hold the memory address of value types and arrays. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Unlike reference types, pointer types are not tracked by the default garbage 
            collection mechanism. For the same reason pointers are not allowed to point to a 
            reference type or even to a structure type which contains a 
            reference type. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            We can say that pointers can point to only unmanaged types which includes 
            all basic data types, enum types, other pointer types and 
            structs 
            which contain only unmanaged types.

<code>
//Example:

#if DEBUG

#endif
</code>
            A preprocessor directive must be the only 
            instruction on a line. <br></br>

            *General-Programming-Knowledge*
            <br></br>
            <brown>Foreach loop:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Foreach loop is used especially when trying to iterrate into a 
            list which has dinamic size, or an array with unknown size.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>The foreach loop is very similar to a for loop</green>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Foreach is used only for Collection of data.
            The difference between for loop and foreach loop is that 
            in foreach loop there is no access to the index.

            <green>C# introduces the following collections:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>Queue</code> is a collection type just like a list or dictionary, dispite that 
            once an object is retrieved from <code>Queue</code> (operation called dequeue), 
            that object
            gets automatically deleted from the beggining of the <code>Queue</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            You can think of a <code>Queue</code> just like a RAR archieve, in order to use an 
            object from the <code>Queue</code>, that object needs to be dequeued into an 
            another object, otherwise it will affect the entire content of the <code>Queue</code>, 
            unless an <code>foreach</code> loop is being used.
            <br></br><br></br>
            To prevent an object be deleted from the <code>Queue</code>, you 
            have to use a 
            <code>foreach</code> loop or the <code>.Peak</code> function. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            If you iterate through the <code>Queue</code> 
            using <code>foreach</code> loop, 
            and effect changes without affecting the content of the <code>Queue</code>.

  <code>Stack</code> is a collection that uses the principle LIFO - Last In First Out, 
  and which can be accessed and handled similarly to a list.
  <br></br><br></br>
  Once an element gets retrieved from the <code>Stack</code> that object will be removed, 
  unless a <code>foreach</code> loop, or the <code>.Peek</code> function it's used.

        A function or method can be overloaded using different number of parameters,

        Kinds of parameters are: input parameters, output parameters, reference parameters.
        Types of parameters are: float, int, double, char, etc...
        
        Overloading means that you can have multiple functions with the same name, but 
        respecting at least one of the criteria above (also it can respect all of the 
        criteria above). 
        
        This means that the signature of the overloaded function must be different from 
        the primary function.
        
        Signature consist in number, type and kind of parameters, and also in the code inside 
        the brackets. But a signature does not consist in the return type of the function, 
        the access modifier of the function, or the optional parameters (params) of the function.
        
        So a function CANNOT be overloaded ONLY by using different return types, access modifiers, 
        or optional params, it must be respected the criteria above.

            *General-Programming-Knowledge*
             The <code>enum</code> is like an <code>array</code> of <code>boolean</code> values, 
             in which only one can be <code>true</code> at a time.
             <br></br> <br></br> 
             This is useful while creating game engines, or software engines, 
             to know when a certain option is available. 
             <br></br><br></br> 
             Also this is used to control and interract the states in a certain application.

            <br></br> <br></br> 
            
             An unhandled exception would provide annoying error message to a user, 
             which could make the program be devoid using.
             <br></br> 
             An unhandled exception could also provide important information to a hacker.
             <br></br><br></br> 
             
             While handling the exceptions the <code>catch</code> block containing the specific 
             classes must be placed above the general class which should be the last one 
             at the bottom.
             <br></br> <br></br> 
             In this way specific exceptions will be handled first and in case the 
             <code>exception</code> was not handled
             specifically then it can be handled generically with the general <code>Exception Class</code>.

            <green>
            An interface in C# is mostly like a class but with some differences:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
             1. An <code>interface</code> cannot have field members/variable members (can have only 
             functions/methods, delegates, events or properties).
             <br></br><br></br>
             2. An <code>interface</code> cannot contain implementations for the functions/methods
             (an implementation of a function/method is the code between the brackets).
             <br></br><br></br>
             3. An <code>interface</code> has <code>public</code> fields set by default, so inside an 
             <code>interface</code> you 
             cannot use the <code>public</code> acces-modifier for its members.
             <br></br><br></br>
             4. A class can inherit from an <code>interface</code>. But with the condition of providing 
             the implementation for all the <code>interface</code> function/method members.
             <br></br><br></br>
             5. When a class provides implementation of an <code>interface</code> function member, 
             it also needs to make the member function <code>public</code>. 
             (The <code>public</code> access modifier must be used.)
             <br></br><br></br>
             6. A <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code> can inherit from MORE interfaces 
             at the same time. 
             Whereas a <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code> cannot inherit from
             more then one <code>class</code>.
             <br></br><br></br>
             7. An <code>interface</code> cannot be instanciated (an instance, 
             object of the <code>interface</code> 
             cannot be created), because doing this it would mean that you would be able to call 
             a function from the <code>interface</code>, and the <code>interface</code> cannot contain
             implemented members.

             A <code>stringbuilder</code> is a data type just like <code>string</code>. 
             <br></br><br></br>
             The main difference between them is that the <code>stringbuilder</code> is 
             mutable.
             Mutable means that once that is created the <code>string</code> can be 
             changed, whereas 
             <code>System.string</code> is not mutable, once created cannot be change. 
             <br></br><br></br>
             If you try to change a <code>string</code> after it was been initialized, the system will 
             create another object of the <code>string</code> in
             memory and pass the new value of the <code>string</code> to that object, 
             but the old object 
             which holds the old value of the <code>string</code> will not be cleaned
             until the end of the program, when the garbage collector does its work.
             <br></br><br></br>
             A <code>stringbuilder</code> should be used everytime when a <code>string</code> 
             that's created 
             tends to 
             change its value, in this way, only a single object will
             be created in memory no matter how many times its value will change, 
             because it's mutable.

            A partial class is a unique feature of C#. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            It can break the functionality of a single 
            <code>class</code> into many files. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            When the application is compiled, these files are then 
            reassembled into a single <code>class</code> file. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>partial</code> keyword is 
            used to build a <code>partial class</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>
            A partial class its used to separate/split a class into two or more parts, 
            across different files.
            </brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            If the part of the class are in different files, those files must be 
            contained in the same assembly (directory of project), otherwise
            the compilation will fail. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A partial class can also be used in techniques of splitting an 
            interface into more parts successfully.
             <br></br><br></br>
             <green>
             Important rules of partial classes:
             </green>
             <br></br><br></br>
             
             1. Without the partial keyword into the class declaration, 
             the compiler will not 
             know the intention of creating a partial class.
             <br></br><br></br>
             2. All the parts of a partial class needs to be contained by 
             the same namespace 
             and assembly.<br></br><br></br>
             3. All the parts must use the partial keyword in their declaration.
             <br></br><br></br>
             4. All the parts must use the same access modifier in their declaration.
             <br></br><br></br>
             5. If any of the parts is declared as abstract, the entire class will be 
             abstract (even if only a part was declared abstract).
             <br></br><br></br>
             6. If any of the parts is declared as sealed, the entire class will 
             be sealed.
             <br></br><br></br>
             7. If any of the parts is declared to be inherited from a a class, 
             the entire class will be inherited from that class. 
             <br></br><br></br>
             8. Different parts of the partial class cannot specify that they are 
             inherited from 
             different classes.
             <br></br>
             Multiple class inheritance is not allowed in C#.
             <br></br><br></br>
             9. Different parts of the partial class can specify that they inherits 
             from different interfaces, so after the compilation the partial class
             will be inherited from all the specified interfaces (even if they were 
             specified in different parts of the class).
             <br></br><br></br>
             10. The members declared to a part of the partial class are available to all 
             the part of the partial class (available in the entire class).

            <green>In C#:</green> 
            <br></br><br></br>
             An abstract class is similar to an interface, 
             dispite that it can contain 
             variable_members(field members) , and that
             an abstract class it's acting like a class when it comes to 
             inheritance.
             <br></br><br></br>
             An abstract class can have implementation
             for some or even for all its members/field, while the interface 
             cannot.
             <br></br><br></br>
             An abstract class can use the (public) 
            access modifiers whereas an interface cannot. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface can be inherited only from another interface, 
            while an abstract class
            can be inherited either from an interface or abstract class. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A class can inherit from multiple interfaces at the
            same time whereas a class cannot inherit from multiple classes.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Rules for abstract classes in C#:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            
             1. An abstract class cannot be instanciated (an instance 
             of the class cannot be created).<br></br>
             <br></br>
             2. An abstract class can contain abstract members, and the 
             abstract members
             are not allowed to be implemented in
             that class.<br></br>
             <br></br>
             3. An abstract class can inherit (can have children classes), and every child 
             of the class must provide its
             own implementations for the abstract members of the parent class.<br></br>
             <br></br>
             4. Any class provides single inheritance (the child of the class can have 
             only one parent/base class).<br></br>
             <br></br>
             5. An abstract class can only be used as a base class. 
             So an abstract class cannot be sealed.<br></br>
             <br></br>
             6. If a class that's inherited from an abstract class 
             doesn't wish to provide implementation for the parent class
             abstract members, then that class can be also 
             set as abstract.<br></br>

        <name>JavaScript</name>
        <description>
            JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core 
            technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript 
            on the client side for webpage behavior.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. 
            These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most 
            popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
            <br></br><br></br>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time 
            compiled language that conforms 
            to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
            object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is 
            multi-paradigm, 
            supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative 
            programming styles. 
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, 
            regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            Difference between JavaScript and PHP is that 
            JavaScript is running in the client 
            computer's browser, and its performance depends only on the client 
            computer's specifications. 
            Whereas PHP is a programming language that runs on a server so when 
            the client is using a PHP script its computer will make a request to 
            the server with the purpose of getting the compilation result and 
            transfer that information back to the client computer.

            JavaScript has undergone significant 
            transformations, playing an important role in the evolution of web development. 
            With these changes, an abundance

            <green>Node.js</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript 
            runtime environment that can run on Windows, 
            Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes 
            JavaScript code outside a web browser.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools 
            and for server-side scripting. 
            The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web 
            page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application 
            development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for 
            the server versus client-side programming.

            React is the library for web and native user interfaces out of 
            individual pieces called components written in JavaScript.
            <br></br><br></br>
            React's declarative syntax facilitates the creation of complex user interfaces, 
            and it provides a vast range of tools, including Redux, for state management. 
            This makes React a powerful choice for scalable and maintainable applications, 
            utilizing modular and reusable components.
            <br></br><br></br>
            React Native brings the React programming paradigm to platforms like Android and iOS.

            jQuery is a JavaScript library which greatly simplifies JavaScript programming.
            jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich. It makes things like HTML document 
            traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use 
            API that works across a multitude of browsers. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            With a combination of versatility and extensibility,

            Ajax short for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML" is a set of web development techniques 
            that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications.
            <br></br><br></br>
            With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously 
            (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.

            <green>
            OOP in JavaScript:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The objects can be classifed in 2 categories:<br></br>
            
            - standard built-in objects;<br></br>
            - custom objects;<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
            In Javascript the concept called of "class" is different, so objects are 
            not built based on classes alone, but also based on functions or 
            literal notations (or singletons).
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of creating objects in JavaScript:

//Creating an object using an function as Object Constructor:

function Employee (firstName, lastName) //This will be the constructor;
{
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.LastName = lastName;
    
    //This is an object method:
    this.getFullName = function () {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.LastName;
    }
}

//Creating an instance of the object:

var emp = new Employee("Alan", "Walker");
document.write("First Name: " + emp.firstName + "&lt;br&gt;");
document.write("Last Name: " + emp.LastName + "&lt;br&gt;");
document.write("Full Name: " + emp.getFullName() + "&lt;br&gt;");

//Creating a class with Object Constructor:
class Student
{

    constructor(firstName, lastName)
    {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.LastName = lastName;
    }
    getFullName() 
    {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.LastName;
    }
}

var stud = new Student("Alan", "Walker");
document.write("First Name: " + stud.firstName + "&lt;br&gt;");
document.write("Last Name: " + stud.LastName + "&lt;br&gt;");
document.write("Full Name: " + stud.getFullName() + "&lt;br&gt;");

//Creating an object using a Variable/Literal Notation or Singleton:

var objct = { //in this case we already create an object/instance.

    //Here we are now describing the functionality of the object:

    // In this case instead of equal sign for assignment 
    //we use colon operator and coma afterwards;
    
    firstName: "Alan", 
    lastName: "Walker",
    
    getFullName: function ()
    {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
} 

//Displaying the information about this objct:

document.write("&lt;br&gt;First Name: " + objct.firstName + "&lt;br&gt;");
document.write("Last Name: " + objct.lastName + "&lt;br&gt;");
document.write("Full Name: " + objct.getFullName() + "&lt;br&gt;");

</code>
            <br></br>
            <green>Differences between the Object Constructor and Object Literal/Singleton:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In the constructor case the properties are separed by their values 
            using = operator, whereas in case of literal notation 
            we use : operator;
            <br></br><br></br>
            In case of contructor we use ; to separate the properties, in 
            literal notation we use , 
            instead.
            <br></br><br></br>
            With the constructor method, you first need to create an instance 
            in order to access its properties, but with literal notation the 
            instance is already created, so you can just access it. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Objects created using literal notation are singletons, 
            this mean that when a value is 
            changed for an instance, it affects all the instances created. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            This is happening because all the instances created from literal notation 
            will reference the same set of values, so if any of them make a change, that change will 
            affect the whole set of instances.
            <br></br>
            Whereas this is not the case using constructor objects.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>
            When to use Object Constructor or Object Literal/Singleton:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            When multiple instances of an object are needed the object contructor will be used.
            <br></br>
            When single instance of an object is needed the object literal can be used.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Singleton means that the object cannot have multiple instances 
            without affecting one another. <br></br>
            That's why the object literal is a singleton.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The common way used for creating objects in all the OOP languages is by using 
            Object Constructor.

        <reflection>
            *General-Programming-Knowledge*
            <br></br>
            Reflection allows the inspection of meta data, 
            assemblies, modules and type.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If the object is derived from a base class than
            reflection can also inspect the parent/base class data.
<code>
//Example of reflection in JavaScript

var Class = function (objName, objID, objType) {
    //These are public fields:
    this.ObjectName = objName;
    this.ObjectID= objID;
    this.ObjectType = objType;
}

//These are public methods:
Class.prototype.getObjectName = function () {
    return this.ObjectName + "&lt;br&gt;";
}

Class.prototype.getObjectID = function () {
    return this.ObjectID + "&lt;br&gt;";
}

Class.prototype.getObjectType = function () {
    return this.ObjectType + "&lt;br&gt;";
}

var Class = new Class ("Car", "2", "Base Class");

//Creating a foreach loop:

    //Checking if the property is a variable:
    if(typeof Class[property] != "function")
    {

        //A property of class can be accessed using ClassName[foreach_variable].
    }
}

document.write("&lt;br&gt;");
//Another foreach loop:
for (var p in Class)
{
    //Checking if a property is not inherited:
    if( Class.hasOwnProperty(p) )

            In other programming languages a class inherits from 
            another class, 
            but in Javascript an object will only inherits from another 
            object (this is called prototype based inheritance).
            <br></br><br></br>
            Also it's not possible for a constructor to
            inherit from another constructor.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A constructor can inherit only from an instance 
            of another (also called object).
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of inheritance in JavaScript:

//Creating a singleton object constructor:

var Vehicle = function (Name, Traction)
{
    this.name = Name;
    this.traction = Traction;
}

/*
Creating a function object constructor will work as well:

function Vehicle(Name, Traction)
{
    this.name = Name;
    this.traction = Traction;
}
*/

//Creating a function using the prototype object:
Vehicle.prototype.getName = function ()
{
    return this.name;
}
Vehicle.prototype.getTraction = function()
{
    return this.traction;
}

//Creating another singleton object:

//Inheritance can also be made using the first singleton object(var Vehicle), 
//as well, but the main fields should be initialized first. 
//Example:

var car = function (speed, acceleration)
{
    //this keyword refers to the current instance's field.
    this.speed = speed;
    this.acceleration = acceleration;
}

//Creating an object from the singleton constructor:
var vehicle = new Vehicle("Bike", "2 wheels");

//Creating the inheritance:
car.prototype = vehicle; 
//Now the any object of the car constructor is a child of the "vehicle" object.

//Creating an object of the constructor "car".

document.write("The following fields are inherited: &lt;br&gt;");

//calling the functions inherited from parent object.
document.write("Name: " + c.getName() + "&lt;br&gt;"); 
document.write("Traction: " + c.getTraction() + "&lt;br&gt;"); 

/*
Adding a new method to the parent object will automatically 
make it available to the child object.

.hasOwnProperty() - this method will check whether a property/field/variable 
is defined on the actual object or prototype. 

By that it can be found all the inherited properties.
*/

document.write("Is Name a Property of c Object: " + c.hasOwnProperty("name") + "&lt;br&gt;");

            Abstract object constructors are those constructors that 
            cannot be instantiated. That means that no object can be 
            created out of them. 
            The purpose of using such constructors is to provide inheritance 
            to other prototypes. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            In this way the functionality can be shared amongst the objects without 
            needing any instances.

            Blocking a constructor from being instantiated will result in error.

    throw Error ("Cannot instantiate an abstract object.");
    
}

//This is a public-static method of House object;
House.prototype.printMsg = function()
{
    document.write("Printing a message!" + "&lt;br&gt;");
}

function Home(pn)

    //Using the base object (Home) field named personName;
    personName = pn;
    
    this.getHomeOwnerName = function ()
    {

    }
}

//Creating the inheritance:

//House is gonna be the base class for Home constructor

Home.prototype = Object.create(House.prototype); 

/*
Object.create - will create an object without using the constructor.
*/

//Creating an instance of the child object:
var h = new Home("Adrian");

//Using the child object method and parent object field:
document.write("Owner's name: " + h.getHomeOwnerName() + "&lt;br&gt;");

            TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing which
            also facilitates the use of generic-programming.
            <br></br><br></br>
            This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, 
            allowing developers to add data types.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>
            Why should I use TypeScript?
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand 
            what types of data are being passed around within the script.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have 
            any information! 
            So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.
            <br></br><br></br>
            TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within 
            the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
            <br></br><br></br>
            For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a <code>string</code> into a 
            function that expects a number. JavaScript will not do that.
            <br></br><br></br>
            TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the 
            specified types match 
            before running the code, not while running the code.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Generics allow creating 'type variables' which can be used to 
            create classes, functions and 
            type aliases that don't need to explicitly define the types that they use.
            <br></br>

//Example of generic programming in JavaScript using TypeScript:

{
  return [v1, v2];
}
console.log(createPair&lt;string, number&gt;('hello', 42)); 

//OUTPUT: ['hello', 42]

            In order to add static typing so that JavaScript can work with 
            data types, the TypeScript was introduced. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by 
            Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Example of using TypeScript data-types:
<code>
//String data-type:
var name:string = "John";

//Number data-type:
var score1:number = 50;
var score2:number = 42.50

//Array data-type
var alphas:string[]; 
alphas = ["1","2","3","4"] 

//Tuple data-type
var mytuple = []; 
mytuple[0] = 120 
mytuple[1] = 234

//Union data-type
var val:string|number 
val = 12 

//Interface data-type:
interface IPerson { 
   firstName:string, 
   lastName:string, 
   sayHi: ()=>string 
} 

//Classes
class Shape { 
   Area:number 
   
   constructor(a:number) { 
      this.Area = a 
   }

            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>forEach()</code> method of Array instances executes a provided function once 
            for each array element.
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of foreach loop in JavaScript
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach((element) => console.log(element));

            <br></br><br></br>
            An array is a collection of variables which can take 
            any type of values. A JavaScript Array is much like a 
            Vector or a List, 
            being dynamic in length (resizeable).
            <br></br><br></br>
            For example: an array could store both strings and 
            integer values in it.
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of creating an array in JavaScript:

//Creating an array without a constructor:
var arr = ["James", 10, 2];

//Another ways to create an array without a constructor:
var arr2 = []; //Creating an array (without constructor), the size is not specified.

/*
Dispite the other C-like languages, creating an array using this syntax make it resizeable.
*/

arr2[0]= 22; //the array length is now 1.
arr2[1]= 44; //the array length is now 2.

//Creating an array using the constructor

var arr3 = new Array(5); // the 5 between the parenthesis specifies the length.
//The elements of arr3 are not initialized.

//Creating an array using constructor, the elements are specified.
var arr4 = new Array(26,8,1994); 

/*
The elements can be specified while creating an array using a constructor, 
by using multiple arguments when calling it. 
So, you cannot create and initialize an array with a single element, using this syntax. 
*/

        <collection-methods>
            *General-Programming-Knowledge*
            The collection methods in Javascript can be divided in 2 categories:
            <br></br>
            
             - mutator methods;<br></br>
             - non-mutator methods;<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
            A mutator method is a method that change or modify the array object
            (in size or content).
            <br></br><br></br>
            The non-mutator methods are the methods that don't perform 
            any change on the array object.
<code>

//Creating an array using constructor.
var arr4 = new Array(26,8,1994); 

//.length property contains the current number of elements within the array
document.write("The length of arr4 is: " + arr4.length + "&lt;br&gt;");

//.pop() - This method removes and returns the last item from the array.
document.write("This element was returned using pop method: " + arr4.pop() + "&lt;br&gt;");

//.shift() - This method removes and returns the first element of the array.
document.write("This element was returned using shift method: " + arr4.shift() + "&lt;br&gt;");

/*
MORE METHODS:

These are Mutator methods:
.push() - This method adds a new item at the end of the array.
.pop() - This method removes and returns the last item from the array.
.unshift() - This method adds a new item at the beginning of the array.
.shift() - This method removes and returns the first element of the array.

.reverse() - This method reverse the element order of an Array Object 
(the last element becomes the first, etc).

.sort() - This method sorts the items of an array (alphabetical, descending or ascending, etc).

.slice() - This method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object 
selected from begin to end (end not included). 
The original array will not be modified. 
It can be used for adding or removing a group of item after the specified index. 

Non-mutator methods:
.contains() - This method returns a boolean value specifying whether the searched value 
is present in the array or not.

.lastIndexOf() - This method returns the position of the last occurrence of a specified value.
.indexOf() - This method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value.

            object instance of a class. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object 
            is created using the <code>new</code> keyword.

            <br></br><br></br>
             When creating 2 functions with the same name and different
             number of arguments in JavaScript, the function declared later 
             will replace the function 
             declared sooner, in the global namespace. 
             <br></br><br></br>
             This process is called namespace pollution (or name collision). 
             <br></br><br></br>
             Also if the scripts are written in different files, the file 
             which is loaded last will replace the function 
             declared into the file which was loaded first.
             <br></br>
<code>
//Example of namespace pollution

function PrintSomething()
{
    alert("This is the first function.");
}

function PrintSomething(a) //this function will replace the first function declared above;
{
    alert("This is the second function.");
}

PrintSomething(5);

//This is the second function.

            All the operations in JavaScript are non-blocking and are executed in the event loop. 
            <br></br>
            This single-threaded nature along with event loop allows

            <br></br><br></br>
            Similarly with creating 2 variables with the same name but in 
            different scope (global and local).
            <br></br><br></br>
            The global namespace in JavaScript can be accessed using <code>window.Object</code> 
            - where Object is an item in the global namespace "window".
<code>
//Example of creating a namespace in JavaScript:

//Create a variable named NameSpace 
//if such an object already exists, than my variable will take its value,
//otherwise my variable will be an empty object {};
var NameSpace = NameSpace || {} 

//Creating a nested namespace/object;
NameSpace.a = NameSpace.a || {}

            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented 
            programming language that is 
            designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
            <br></br><br></br>
            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let 
            programmers write once, 
            run anywhere meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support 
            Java without the need to recompile. <br></br><br></br>
            
            Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any 
            Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the 
            underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, 
            but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
            The Java runtime provides 
            dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code 
            modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

            In Java each class must have its own .java file. 
            There cannot be multiple classes in the same file,
            unless some of them are inner classes 
            (class inside another class).

            Encapsulation in Java:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping 
            the data (variables) 
            and code acting on the data (methods) 
            together as a single unit. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be 
            hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through 
            the methods of their current classes.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of using Encapsulation in Java
 
// Person Class
class Person 
{
    // Encapsulating the name and age
    // only approachable and used using
    // methods defined
    
    private String name;
    private int age;
 
    public String getName() { return name; }
 
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }

            <br></br>
            <green>Inheritance in Java:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. 
            But multiple 
            inheritances is still possible through the use of interfaces.
            <br></br>
            Any Java class can inherit from a single class 
            and/or multiple interfaces.
            <br></br><br></br>
            By inheritance the child class (class which inherits) extends 
            the functionality of the parent class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Implements vs Extends:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            - extends is for extending a class (class inheritance);<br></br>
            - extends can also be used for interface inheritance. 
            An interface can extend another interface.
            <br></br>
            - implements is for implementing an interface 
            (interface to class inheritance);<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Through implements the interfaces exhibit the same characteristics 
            to the classes which are implementing them.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The main difference between an interface and a class is that 
            in an interface cannot implement any 
            of the declared methods. 
            <br></br>
            Only the class that "implements" 
            the interface can implement the methods. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Also
            an interface cannot contain instance fields/variables. 
            The only fields that can appear in an 
            interface must be declared both static and final.
            <br></br>
            A final variable, also called a "constant", is a variable 
            whose value it cannot be
            change after it's been initialized. 
            <br></br>
            A static variable is a variable 
            shared among all the instances of a class and which can be accessed
            from the class even with no instances by using: 
            <code>ClassName.variable;</code>
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface is not extended by a class; 
            it is implemented by a class.

            <green>Abstraction in Java:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and 
            interfaces.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A class which contains the abstract keyword in its declaration is 
            known as abstract class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, 
            i.e., methods without a body.
            <br></br>
            Example: ( <code>public void get();</code> )
            <br></br><br></br>
            But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class 
            must be declared abstract.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.
            <br></br><br></br>
            To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another 
            class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations 
            to all the abstract methods in it.
<code>
//Example of abstraction using interfaces:

//Defining an interface
interface Animal 
{
    public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
    public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal 
{
    public void animalSound() 
    {
        // The body of animalSound() is provided here
        System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
    }
    
    public void sleep() 
    {
        // The body of sleep() is provided here
        System.out.println("Zzz");
    }
}

class Main 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
        myPig.animalSound();
        myPig.sleep();
    }
}

            <green>Generic Programming in Java:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Generic Classes:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In Java a generic class declaration is similar to a 
            regular non-generic class declaration, 
            except that the class name is followed by a 
            <code>&lt;type parameter&gt;</code> section.
            <br></br><br></br>
            For all generics the <code>&lt;type parameter&gt;</code> section can 
            contain one or more <code>&lt;type parameters&gt;</code> separated by commas.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Such generics are called parameterized types because they 
            accept one or more parameters.
<code>
//Example of generic class declaration in Java:

package project29;

public class GenericClass &lt;T&gt; 
{
   private T t;

   public void set(T t) 
   {
      this.t = t;
   }

   public T get() 
   {
      return t;
   }
}

</code>

        In Java each data type has an object correspondant: 
        <br></br>
        <code>int</code> (primitive) -> <code>Integer</code> (object)<br></br>
        <code>double</code> (primitive) -> <code>Double</code> (object)<br></br>
        etc...
        <br></br><br></br>
        We could use generics to wrap primitive types 
        into objects.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Example: <code>java.lang.Integer class</code>  wraps a value of the 
        primitive type <code>int</code> into an object. 
        <br></br>
        The object of type <code>Integer</code> contains a single field 
        whose type is <code>int</code>
        <br></br><br></br>
        <brown>Generic Methods:</brown>
        <br></br><br></br>
        Generic methods are methods that can be called with arguments of 
        different types.
        Based on the types of the arguments passed to the 
        generic method, the compiler handles each method 
        call appropriately.

        GenericClass &lt;Integer&gt; FirstGeneric_Class = new GenericClass&lt;Integer&gt;();
        FirstGeneric_Class.set(2);
        System.out.printf("Value of GenericClass object: %d\n", FirstGeneric_Class.get());
        
        //Creating some arrays:
        Integer [] myArray = new Integer[] {1,42,13,24,5};
        Character [] myCharArray = new Character[] {'D', 'N', 'C', 'A'};
        
        //Calling the generic method printArray() on 2 different arrays:
        printArray(myArray);
        printArray(myCharArray);
        
        //Keep the window opened until a key is pressed:
        Scanner myscanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        myscanner.next();
    }
    
    //Creating a generic method/function:
    public static &lt; E &gt; void printArray( E[] inputArray ) 
    {
        // Display array elements
        for(E element : inputArray) 
        {
         System.out.printf("%s ", element);
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}

            Java also contains a foreach loop:
            <br></br><br></br>
            The foreach loop is used exclusively for collections such as:

            <br></br>
            By using a foreach loop you can iterate through all the items in that 
            collection and access their values without using indexes.

            <br></br><br></br>
            A Vector is a dynamic array that can change it's 
            size/capacity and is 
            capable of storing any type of data/object. Meaning that a Vector 
            of objects 
            can mix different types together such as: 
            integers and strings.
            <br></br>

            <brown>ArrayLists</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The ArrayList class extends AbstractList and 
            implements the List interface. 
            ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed. 
            This gives us a new collection data type that can be used exactly as 
            Vectors, Lists, Stacks, Dictionaries.
            <br></br><br></br>
            ArrayLists are created with an initial size of 10 elements. 
            When this size is exceeded, the collection is automatically enlarged. 
            <br></br>
            When objects are removed, the ArrayList may be shrunk.
            <br></br><br></br>
            NOTE: ArrayLists cannot hold primitive data types such as int, 
            double, char, and long.
            <br></br><br></br>
            To create an ArrayList that store primitive values such as those mentioned
            above, the ArrayList must be created using the corresponding object 
            of these primitives.
            <br></br>
            Example: <br></br>
            - for int the corresponding class is Integer;
            <br></br>
            - for double the corresponding class is Double;
            <br></br><br></br>
            These classes wrap the primitive types into an object.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The methods available for the ArrayLists are similar to those of 
            Vector, List, Stack, Dictionary. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            So you can call methods such as: <code>Add()</code>, <code>Remove()</code>, 
            <code>RemoveAt()</code>, etc.
<code>
//Example of working with ArrayLists in Java:

package project20;

import java.util.ArrayList; //used for ArrayList Collection type.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Project20 {
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; al = new ArrayList();
        al.add(22);
        al.add(44);
        al.add(59);
        
        //Accessing the elements:
        for(int i: al)
        {
            System.out.printf("%d ", i);
        }
        
        System.out.println();
        Scanner myscanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        myscanner.next();
    }
    
}

            <brown>Stacks</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Stack is a subclass of Vector that implements the LIFO standard 
            (last-in first-out).
            <br></br><br></br>
            Stack only defines the default constructor, which creates an 
            empty stack.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Stack includes all the methods defined by Vector, and adds several of 
            its own.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A stack has the same properties as a vector, it's 
            dynamic in size, and
            can store objects of any type.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Stacks get automatically resized to fit the objects pushed in.
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of working with Stack.

package project16;

import java.util.Scanner; //used for Scanner class;
import java.util.Stack; //used for stack collection;

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Stack newStack = new Stack(); //Stack of objects
        Stack&lt;Integer&gt; intStack; //Stack of integers;
        
        //Adding objects to the Stack:

            <brown>Dictionaries</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>

                The Dictionary class is an abstract class that 
                defines a data structure for mapping keys to values.
                <br></br>
                This is useful in cases where you want to be able to access data via a particular 
                key rather than an integer index.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Since the Dictionary class is abstract, it provides only the 
                framework for a 
                key-mapped data structure rather than a specific implementation.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Given a key and value, you can store the value in a 
                Dictionary object. 
                Once the value is stored, you can retrieve it by using its key. 
                Thus, like a map, a dictionary can be thought of as a 
                list of key/value pairs.
                <br></br>
                The Dictionary class is obsolete. 
                You should implement the Map interface to 
                obtain key/value storage functionality.

        <brown>Lists</brown>
        <br></br><br></br>
        The List interface extends Collection and declares the 
        behavior of a collection that stores a sequence of elements.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Elements can be inserted or accessed by their position in the List 
        by using a zero-based index.
        <br></br><br></br>
        A List may contain duplicate elements.
        <br></br><br></br>
        In addition to the methods defined by Collection, the List defines 
        some of its own.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Several of the List methods will throw an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> 
        if the collection cannot be modified, and a <code>ClassCastException</code> is generated 
        when one object is incompatible with the other.

        <collection-methods>
            The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to 
            store and manipulate the group of objects.
            <br></br><br></br>
            There are many methods declared in the Collection interface:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean add(E e)</code><br></br>
            It is used to insert an element in this collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean addAll(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt; c)</code><br></br>
            It is used to insert the specified collection 
            elements in the invoking collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean remove(Object element)</code><br></br>
            It is used to delete an element from the collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean removeAll(Collection&lt;?&gt; c)</code><br></br>
            It is used to delete all the elements of the specified collection 
            from the invoking collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>default boolean removeIf(Predicate&lt;? super E&gt; filter)</code><br></br>
            It is used to delete all the elements of the collection 
            that satisfy the specified predicate.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean retainAll(Collection&lt;?&gt; c)</code><br></br>
            It is used to delete all the elements of invoking collection 
            except the specified collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public int size()</code><br></br>
            It returns the total number of elements in the collection.
            <br></br><br></br>

            It removes the total number of elements from the collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean contains(Object element)</code><br></br>
            It is used to search an element.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean containsAll(Collection&lt;?&gt; c)</code><br></br>
            It is used to search the specified collection in the 
            collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public Iterator iterator()</code><br></br>
            It returns an iterator.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public Object[] toArray()</code><br></br>
            It converts collection into array.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public &lt;T&gt; T[] toArray(T[] a)</code><br></br>
            It converts collection into array. Here, the runtime type of the 
            returned array 
            is that of the specified array.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean isEmpty()</code><br></br>
            It checks if collection is empty.

            its source.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>default Stream&lt;E&gt; stream()</code><br></br>
            It returns a sequential Stream with the collection as its source.

            <code>default Spliterator&lt;E&gt; spliterator()</code><br></br>
            It generates a Spliterator over the specified elements in the 
            collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public boolean equals(Object element)</code>
            It matches two collections.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>public int hashCode()</code><br></br>
            It returns the hash code number of the collection.
            <br></br><br></br>
        </collection-methods>
        <dynamic-memory-allocation>
            Heap space is used for the dynamic memory allocation of 
            Java objects and JRE (Java Runtime Environment) classes 
            at runtime. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            New objects are always created in heap space, and the 
            references to these objects are stored in stack memory. 
            <br></br>
            These objects have global access and we can access them from 
            anywhere in the application.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Dynamic memory allocation in Java:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            All Java objects are dynamically allocated. 
            The variables used in the application are stored in stack but these variables 
            only store references to objects. 
            <br></br>
            If the variable dies the object still exists as 
            long as referenced by other variables.
            <br></br><br></br>
            This means is we always pass objects to other functions by 
            reference 
            (no copies are performed behind the scenes).

            In Java: destructors are also known as finalizers that are 
            non-deterministic. <br></br>
            The allocation and deallocation of objects is handled by the 
            garbage collector. <br></br>
            The invocation of finalizers is not guaranteed because it 
            invokes implicitly.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Advantages of Destructor:</brown><br></br>
            
            1. It releases the resources occupied by the object.<br></br>
            2. No explicit call is required, it is automatically invoked at the end of the 
            program execution.<br></br>
            3. It does not accept any parameter and cannot be overloaded.<br></br>
            
            <br></br>
            Java <code>finalize()</code> method works the same as the destructor. 
            It is not a 
            destructor however, but it provides extra security.
            <br></br>            
            For example: It ensures the use of 
            external resources like closing the file, etc. before shutting down the 
            program.

            <br></br><br></br>
            In Java: enums can have constructors, and it needs to have 
            constructors 
            if they are provided with values. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Enums provides both string values and 
            int values in the same patch.
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of enums in Java:

    //Defining the fields:
    South(0), West(180), North(90), East(260);
    private final int Degrees; 
    // a place to store the value for each field.
    
    //This constructor has the role of initializing 
    //the above fields with their values:

            <green>Enumerations in Java:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The Enumeration interface defines the methods by which you can 
            enumerate 
            (obtain one at a time) the elements in a collection of objects.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Enumerations must not be confused with enums.
             They are different types, different objects, 
            with different utility.

            In Java: Threads can be created by using two mechanisms : 
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            1. Extending the Thread class; <br></br>
            2. Implementing the Runnable Interface;

            <brown>Thread creation by extending the Thread class:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            We create a class that extends the java.lang.Thread class. 
            This class overrides the run() method available in 
            the Thread class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A thread begins its life inside run() method. 
            We create an object of our 
            new class and call start() method to start the 
            execution of a thread. 
            Start() invokes the run() method on the Thread object.
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of multithreading in Java 
//by extending the Thread class:

class MultithreadingDemo extends Thread

        <br></br>
        <brown>Thread creation by implementing the Runnable Interface</brown>
        <br></br><br></br>
        We create a new class which implements java.lang.Runnable 
        interface and override run() 
        method. 
        <br></br>
        Then we instantiate a Thread object and call 
        start() method on this object. 
        <br></br>

            <green>Interfaces in Java:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface is a reference type in Java that 
            is similar to class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A class implements an interface, 
            thereby inheriting the 
            abstract methods of the interface.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface is basically a collection of abstract methods. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Along with the abstract methods, an interface may 
            also contain constants
            (final variables), static variables,  
            default methods, static methods, and nested types.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A nested type is a type defined within a type 
            such as: 
            a class defined within a class or an interface defined
            within an interface.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A final variable is also called a "constant". It is a variable 
            whose value cannot be
            change after it's been initialized. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The method bodies may exist only for the default methods and/or 
            static methods.
<code>
//Example of interface with constants, 
//default and static methods:

public interface Electronic 
{

    // Constant variable
    String LED = "LED";

    // Abstract method
    int getElectricityUse();

    // Static method
    static boolean isEnergyEfficient(String electtronicType) 
    {
        if (electtronicType.equals(LED)) 
        {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    //Default method
    default void printDescription() 
    {
        System.out.println("Electronic Description");
    }
}
</code>
            <br></br>
            A static variable  or method is one which is shared 
            among all the 
            instances of a class and which can be accessed directly
            from the class even with no instances by using: 
            <code>ClassName.variable;</code>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The default methods can be defined inside the interface by using the 
            default
            keyword. These methods are non-abstract methods meaning they have an 
            implementation.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The concept of default method is used to define a method with default
            implementation. 
            The class implementing the interface can override the 
            default method also, in order
            to provide a more specific implementation for the method.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Defining an interface is similar to defining a class. 
            But a class 
            describes the attributes and behaviors of an object,
            whereas an interface contains the declaration of the behaviors 
            that a class needs to implement.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Just like classes, there can be only one interface in a .java file. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Java does not allow that multiple interfaces and/or classes be 
            defined in the same file, unless they are nested.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The only way to have multiple classes/interfaces defined in 
            one file is by having them defined as nested types.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Once that a class implements an interface that class is 
            obliged to 
            provide implementations for all the abstract methods within 
            the interface:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>
            Properties of Interfaces:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the abstract 
            keyword while declaring an interface.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Each method within the interface is implicitly abstract, so the 
            abstract keyword is also not needed for declaring the methods.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The methods declared within the interface are implicitly public.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>
            Similarities between interfaces and classes:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface can contain any number of methods.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface is written in a file with a .java extension, with the name of 
            the 
            interface matching the name of the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The bytecode of an interface appears in a .class file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The interfaces appear in packages, and their corresponding bytecode 
            file must be in a directory structure that matches the package name.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>
            Differences between interfaces and classes:
            </green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            You cannot instantiate an interface.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface does not contain any constructors.
            <br></br><br></br>
            All of the methods in an interface are abstract.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface cannot contain instance fields. 
            The only fields that can appear in an interface must be declared 
            both static and final.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface is not extended by a class, it is implemented by a 
            class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An interface can extend multiple other interfaces.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Through implements the interfaces exhibit the same characteristics 
            to the classes which are implementing them.

            <green>Modular Programming in Java:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A module in Java is typically just a .jar file that has a module-info.java 
            file at the root. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A module is a directory containing other directories 
            called packages, 
            where every package contains classes stored in individual 
            .java files.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Java modules help encapsulating packages and managing dependencies:<br></br>
            - a class is a container of fields and methods;<br></br>
            - a package is a container of classes and interfaces;<br></br>
            - a module is a container of packages;<br></br>
            <br></br>
            In Java a module is somehow different than in C/C++.
            <br></br>            
            Since Java only allow one class/interface
            be defined per file, a module is more like a collection of files, 
            than a pair of 2 files (.c and .h) as it is in C/C++.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In Java there cannot be any functions, variable declarations or
            implementations of any sort, outside
            the class. <br></br>
            Everything has to be encapsulated within the class.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Example of modular project in Java:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            1. The module exporting the implementation:
            <br></br>
<code>
//Example of modular project in Java:

//FILEPATH: Implementation_Module/classes/module-info.java

module Implementation_Module 
{
    //this module exports the package:
    exports Implementation_Package;
}
</code>

<code>
//FILEPATH: 
//Implementation_Module/classes/Implementation_Package/Implementation_Class.java

//A package is like a folder/directory
package Implementation_Package;
//This package contains the class with the implementation

public class Implementation_Class 
{
    public void PrintMessage() 
    {
        //This class contains the implementation:
        System.out.println("Hello from Implementation_Module");
    }
    
}
</code>
            <br></br>
            2. The module importing the implementation:
<code>
//FILEPATH: Main_Module/classes/module-info.java

module Main_Module 
{
    //this module requires Implementation_Module:
    requires Implementation_Module;
}
</code>

<code>
//FILEPATH: Main_Module/classes/Main_Package/Main_Class.java

//A package is like a folder/directory
package Main_Package;
//Main_Package requires the implementation

import Implementation_Package.Implementation_Class;
//Implementation is in this package.class

public class Main_Class 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        //Accessing the implementation:
        Implementation_Class obj = new Implementation_Class();
        obj.PrintMessage();
        
        /*
        OUTPUT:
        Hello from Implementation_Module
        */
    }
}

        <indigo>2. Component Implementation:</indigo>
        <br></br><br></br>
        The basic implementation of the component interface. 
        We can have BasicCar class as our component implementation.
        <br></br>
<code>
//the basic implementation of 
//the Car interface

package com.journaldev.design.decorator;

public class BasicCar implements Car 
{
    @Override
    public void assemble() 
    {
        System.out.print("Basic Car.");
    }
}

        <br></br>
        <indigo>3. Decorator:</indigo>

            <br></br><br></br>
            In Java the pure virtual functions/methods are called abstract

            Any class that contains one or more abstract methods
            must also be declared abstract.<br></br>
            If a class contains an abstract method it needs to be 
            abstract and vice versa is not true.<br></br>
            If a non-abstract class extends an abstract class, then the 
            class must implement all the abstract methods of the abstract 
            class else the concrete class has to be declared as 
            abstract as well.<br></br><br></br>
            
            The following combinations of modifiers used on abstract methods

            <code>final</code><br></br>

            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
            Its design 
            philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of 
            significant indentation.
            <br></br><br></br>

            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
            It supports multiple 
            programming paradigms, including structured 
            (particularly procedural), 
            object-oriented and functional programming. 
            It is often described as a 
            "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

            <br></br><br></br>
            Python uses the self keyword to refer to 
            instance variables.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In Python the variables/fields declared within a class but outside of 
            any methodred
            will become class variables/fields and will be shared amongst all instances.
            The variables/fields
            declared within the constructor will become
            instance variables/fields.
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of class definition in Python 3:

#Creating a class:
class Employee:
    #This works like documentation of the class.
    'Common base class for all employees' 

    #This member is a class variable whose value 
    #is shared among all instances of a this class.
    empCount = 0 
    #this is similar to a static variable

    #Creating a constructor for the class:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):    
        #the name of the constructor is 
        #always the same: "__init__"
    
        #Here is the place where the members of the 
        #class gets created and initialized.
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
        Employee.empCount += 1
   
    #The first parameter of any function
    #in the class is always "self"
    def displayCount(self):  
        #That means that the function will display 
        #information about that instance that calls it.
        print ("Total Employee {0}" .format(Employee.empCount))

    def displayEmployee(self):
        print ("Name : {0}, Salary: {1}" .format(self.name,self.salary))

    #Implementing a destructor for the class.
    def __del__(self):
        #This code will be executed when calling 'del instance'
        class_name = self.__class__.__name__
        print ("Employee destroyed")


#Creating the instances:
"This would create first object of Employee class"
emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)
"This would create second object of Employee class"
emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000)

#Calling the functions;
emp1.displayEmployee()
emp2.displayEmployee()
emp1.displayCount()

Employee.displayCount(emp2) 
#This can work like this as well. 
#But it needs to be specified an instance

Employee.displayEmployee(emp1)

#Instead of using the normal statements to access  
#attributes, you can use the following functions
#similar to getters and setters:

hasattr(emp1, 'name')
#Returns true if 'name' attribute exists

getattr(emp1, 'name')    
#Returns value of 'name' attribute

setattr(emp1, 'name', "Mark") 
#Set attribute 'name' at 8

delattr(emp1, 'name')    
# Delete attribute 'name'

#calling this method will now throw an exception
#emp1.displayEmployee()
#as emp1 has no name attribute anymore.

#Accesing build-in class attributes:
print ("Employee.__doc__: {0}" .format(Employee.__doc__))
#__doc__ is the class documentation string or none, if undefined.

print ("Employee.__name__: {0}" .format( Employee.__name__))
#__name__ is the class name

print ("Employee.__module__: {0}" .format( Employee.__module__))
#__module__ is the module name in which the class is defined.

print ("Employee.__bases__: {0}" .format( Employee.__bases__))
#__bases__ a possibly empty tuple containing the base classes
#in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.

print ("Employee.__dict__: {0}" .format( Employee.__dict__))
#__dict__ is a dictionary containing the class's namespace.

#Example:
del emp1 
#this will delete the instance callded emp1.

emp2.displayEmployee()

#emp1.displayEmployee()
#using emp1 will throw an exception

            Python deletes unneeded objects (built-in types or 
            class instances) automatically to free the memory space.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python's garbage collector runs during program execution 
            and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. 
            An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases 
            that point to it changes.
            <br></br><br></br>
            You normally will not notice when the garbage collector 
            destroys an orphaned instance and reclaims its space.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A class can implement the special method <code>__del__()</code>, 
            called a destructor, that is invoked when the 
            instance is about to be destroyed.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Built-In Class Attributes:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            These built-in attributes can be accessed using dot operator(<code>.</code>) just 
            like any other class attribute.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>The atttributes used in the example above are:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>__dict__</code> 
            The attribute contains a dictionary containing the class's namespace.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>__doc__</code>   
            The attribute contains the class documentation string or none, if undefined.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>__name__</code>  
            The attribute contains the class name.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>__bases__</code>  
            The attribute contains a possibly empty tuple containing the base classes, 
            in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>__module__</code>  
            The attribute contains the name of the module in which 
            the class is defined. 
            If the module is the one that is currently running then the module name will 
            be <code>__main__</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            This is used for modular programming:
<code>
//Check whether the python script is ran standalone
//or was imported from a different file.

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    print ("Executed when invoked directly")
else: 
    print ("Executed when imported")

            <green>Inheritance in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Instead of starting from scratch, you can create a class by deriving 
            it from a preexisting class by listing the parent class
            between <code>()</code> parentheses, after the class name.
            <br></br><br></br>
            By inheritance: the child class inherits the attributes of 
            its parent class, 
            and those attributes can be used as if they were defined in the child class. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A child class can also override data members and methods from the 
            parent.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In Python a child class is often refered to as subclass whereas a 
            parent class
            is refered to as superclass.

            <green>Abstraction in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Abstraction in Python refers to the process of creating 
            abstract 
            classes and methods that provide a blueprint for other 
            classes to inherit from.
            <br></br><br></br>
            It allows us to define common attributes and behaviors that can be shared among 
            multiple classes.
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of abstraction in Python:

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

#Defining abstract class:
class democlass(ABC):
    #Defining abstract method:
    @abstractmethod
    def method1(self):
        print ("abstract method")
        return
    
    #Defining concrete method:
    def method2(self):
        print ("concrete method")

#Defining concrete class:
class concreteclass(democlass):
    def method1(self):
        #Calling parent class method:

            Python generics are like hints in Python. They came out in Python 3.5
            and newer versions. 
            <br></br>
            They let you say what type of things your variables, 
            functions, and results are. 
            <br></br>
            It helps you write down what kind of things your 
            code is dealing with, but it doesn't make the computer check it 
            while running the code.

            *General-Programming-Knowledge*
            <br></br>
            <green>Collections in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Lists:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Lists are ordered and changeable collections which 
            allow duplicate values. 
            Ordered means that the items within a list have a 
            defined order, and that order will 
            not change. Changeable means that we can change, add, 
            and remove 
            items in a list after it has been created.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A list is like a vector (dynamic in length) and it can be accessed 
            in the same way, by index. The list collections are indexed 
            starting from 
            0, similar to any other collection from other programming languages.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In Python a list can be created using any type of data.
            The dynamic length of a list, allows appending new elements 
            at the end of the 
            list, so that the size would change automatically.
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of working with lists in Python 3:

#Defining a list:
CharList = ['M','e','s','s','a','g','e']

print('The list is: {0}' .format(CharList))

#Accessing an element of the list:
print('This is the 4th element {0}' .format(CharList[4]))

#Changing an element of the list:
CharList[4] = 'O'
print("The new 4th element is: {0}" .format(CharList[4]))

#Appending elements at the end of the list.
CharList+= ['1', '2'] 
#this is used for temporarily change.
print("The list now, looks like this: {0}" .format(CharList))

CharList.append('3') 
#this is used for permanent change. 
print("The list now, looks like this: {0}" .format(CharList))

#Slicing lists:
print("The sliced list is: {0}" .format(CharList[:5])) 
#slicing a list can be done just like in case of strings.

#Changing multiple items of the list:
CharList[2:] = ['2', '3'] 
#this synthax can only be used on lists, to add multiple
#elements after a given index (will automatically erase 
#the rest of the elements after that index)

print(CharList)

#Emptying the list:
CharList[:] = []
print(CharList)

#Example of unpacking lists in Python:

#Unpacking is the process in which every
#list element gets assigned to individual variable

item, name, price = ["Car", "Mustang Gt", "14000"]
#This is an unpacked list, where each element is actually a variable.

print("item: ", item, " name: ", name, " price: ", price);

#The lists that have many more elements:

            <brown>Dictionaries:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Dictionaries are used to store data values in <code>key:value</code> pairs.
            A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, 
            changeable and do not allow duplicates.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Each key is separated from its value by a colon (<code>:</code>), 
            the items are separated by
            commas (<code>,</code>) and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces <code>{}</code>. 
            <br></br>
            An empty dictionary
            without any items is declared using only two curly braces such as: <code>{}</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Keys are unique within a dictionary while 
            values may not be. The values of a
            dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of 
            an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, 
            or tuples.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An item can be accessed only with a valid key or index, 
            trying to access an item with invalid key or index will 
            result in an error.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Dictionary values have no restrictions. 
            They can be any arbitrary Python objects,
            either standard objects or user-defined objects. 
            However, the same is not true for the keys
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Important aspect: </indigo>
            <br></br>
            More than one entry per key is not allowed. 
            Which means no duplicate key is allowed. 
            When duplicate keys are encountered during assignment, the last
            assignment wins.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Keys must be immutable. Which means you can use 
            strings, numbers or tuples as dictionary  
            keys but something like <code>['key']</code> is not allowed.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Example: <code>dict = {['Name']: 'Zara'}</code>
            <br></br>
            This case is not allowed as the key provided is of type list.
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of working with dictionaries in Python 3:

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}

print ("dict['Name']: {0}" .format(dict['Name']))
print ("dict['Age']: {0}" .format(dict['Age']))

#Updating the dictionary:
print("\nAfter the update:")
dict['Age'] = 8; # update existing entry
dict['Name'] = "DPS School"; # Add new entry
print ("dict['Name']: {0}" .format(dict['Name']))
print ("dict['Age']: {0}" .format(dict['Age']))

#Looping through the dictionary:
for name,key in dict.items(): 
    #treat 'name' as the Name(from dictionary)
    #and key as the Key(value from the dictionary)
    
    print("Key: ", key, "\t Name:", name)

#Deleting dictionary items:
del dict['Name']; 
#remove entry with key 'Name'
#After the deletion the item with key 'Name'
#accessing it will result and error.

dict.clear();     
#remove all entries in dict, the dictionary 
#will be empty.

#Dict.keys() => this will return a list with all the keys in the dictionary

#Zipping a dictionary:

#The zipped dictionary will look like this:

            <brown>Sets:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Sets are like lists that cannot contain duplicate elements.
            <br></br>
            A set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used 
            to store collections of data, 
            the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, 
            all with different qualities and usage.
            <br></br>

            <br></br>
            <brown>Tuples:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. 
            Tuples are 
            sequences, just like lists. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The differences between tuples 
            and lists are:<br></br>
            - tuples cannot be changed whereas lists can be changed;<br></br>
            - tuples use parenthesis <code>()</code>, whereas lists use 
            square brackets <code>[]</code>.<br></br>
            Immutable means constant once initialized it cannot be changed, meaning
            no item can be changed, added or removed from it.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Tuples can however be reinitialized with different values.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Tuples can be sliced meaning you are able to take portions of
            existing tuples to create new tuples.
            <br></br><br></br>
            New tuples can be created by adding 2 
            existing tuples together.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Any set of multiple objects, comma-separated, declared without identifying 
            symbols are by default set to tuples.
            <br></br>
            Tuples can be accessed using indexes. 
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of working with tuples in Python 3:

tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );
tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d";

#An empty tuple is declared like this:
tup1 = ();

#To write a tuple containing a single value you have to 
include a comma, even though there is only one value.
tup1 = (50,); 
print("The tuple contain {0} elements: {1} " .format(len(tup1), tup1[0]))

#Tuples can be reinitialized with other values.
tup1 = (12, 34.56); 
tup2 = ('abc', 'xyz');

#Following action is not valid for tuples
#tup1[0] = 100;

#So let's create a new tuple as follows:

print (tup3)

#Tuples can be DELETED as follows:
del tup3
#print(tup3) -> this will result an error, 
#tup3 won't exist anymore after its deletion

tup3 = tup1 + tup2;

        <dynamic-memory-allocation>
            <green>Dynamic memory allocation in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The memory is allocated to the objects at the run time. <br></br>
            The heap is used to implement dynamic memory management. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Everything in Python is an object which means the memory is
            allocated dynamically and is managed by the 
            Python Memory Management.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python deletes unneeded objects (built-in types or 
            class instances) automatically to free the memory space.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python's garbage collector runs during program execution 
            and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. 
            An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases 
            that point to it changes.

        <read-from-file>
            *General-Programming-Knowledge*
            <green>Read files in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>read()</code> method reads a string from an opened file. 
            <br></br>
            It is important to note that Python strings can contain binary data, 
            apart from text data.
            <br></br><br></br>
            When reading/writing characters from a file the pointer/cursor 
            will move across the
            content of a file, and if it reaches the end, it will need to be reseted 
            using <code>seek()</code> function, before being able to read/write again.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The method <code>tell()</code> returns the current position of the 
            pointer/cursor within the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Passing an argument to the <code>read()</code> method will ensure that everything is 
            read until to the given position within the file content.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Example: <code>MyFile.read(11)</code> 
            <br></br>
            Only the first 11 characters will be extracted from the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>close()</code> method of a file object, flushes 
            any unwritten information and closes the file object, 
            after which no more reading or writing can be done. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of 
            a file is reassigned to another file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            It is a good practice to use the <code>close()</code> method to close a file 
            after finishing operating on the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In order to open a file the <code>open()</code> method it is used. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>open()</code> method takes 2 arguments:<br></br>
            - the filepath of the file to be opened;<br></br>
            - the mode for opening;<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Example: <code>open("file.txt", "w")</code><br></br>
            This will open a file named file.txt placed in the same 
            directory as the <code>.py</code> script.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Modes for opening a file:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The other available modes for opening a file are:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"r"</code> - Opens a file for reading only. 
            <br></br>
            The file pointer/cursor is placed at the beginning of the file. 
            This is the default mode. It throws an error if 
            the file does not exist.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"w"</code> - Opens a file for writing only. 
            <br></br>
            Overwrites the file if the file exists.
            If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"rb"</code> - Opens a file for reading only in binary format. 
            <br></br>
            The file pointer/cursor is placed
            at the beginning of the file. 
            This is the default mode.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"rb+"</code> - Opens a file for both reading and writing in 
            binary format. 
            <br></br>
            The file pointers placed at the beginning of the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"wb"</code> - Opens a file for writing only in binary format. 
            <br></br>
            Overwrites the file if the file exists. 
            If the file does not exist, 
            creates a new file for writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"w+"</code> - Opens a file for both writing and reading.
            <br></br>
            Overwrites the existing file if
            the file exists. 
            If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading
            and writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"wb+"</code> - Opens a file for both writing and reading in 
            binary format. 
            <br></br>
            Overwrites the existing file if 
            the file exists. 
            If the file does not exist, creates a
            new file for reading and writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"a"</code> - Opens a file for appending. <br></br>
            The file pointer/cursor is at the end of the file
            if the file exists. 
            The file is opened in 
            the append mode. If the file does
            not exist, it creates a new file for writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"ab"</code> - Opens a file for appending in binary format. 
            <br></br>
            The file pointer/cursor is at the
            end of the file if the file exists.
            The file is opened in the append mode.
            If the file does not exist, 
            it creates a new file for writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"a+"</code> - Opens a file for both appending and reading.
            <br></br>
            The file pointer/cursor is at the
            end of the file if the file exists.
            The file opens in the append mode. If the
            file does not exist, it creates a new file 
            for reading and writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>"ab+"</code> - Opens a file for both appending and reading 
            in binary format. 
            <br></br>
            The pointer/cursor within the file is poiting to the end of the 
            file if the file exists. 
            If the file does not exist, it creates 
            a new file for reading and writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>File object attributes:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The file object contains several attributes:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>file.closed</code><br></br>
            Returns <code>true</code> if file is closed, <code>false</code> 
            otherwise.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>file.mode</code><br></br>
            Returns the access mode with which the file was 
            opened.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>file.name</code><br></br> 
            Returns name of the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>file.softspace</code><br></br>
            Returns a boolean that indicates whether a space character 
            needs to be printed before another value when using the print statement.
            <br></br><br></br>

            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>write()</code> method writes any string to an open file.
            The <code>write()</code> method does not add a newline character ('\n')
            <br></br><br></br>

            content of a file, and if it reaches the end, it will need to be reseted 
            using <code>seek()</code> function, before being able to read/write again.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>close()</code> method of a file object, flushes 
            any unwritten information and closes the file object, 
            after which no more reading or writing can be done. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of 
            a file is reassigned to another file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            It is a good practice to use the <code>close()</code> method to close a file 
            after finishing operating on the file.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In order to open a file the open() method it is used. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>open()</code> method takes 2 arguments:<br></br>
            <br></br>
            - the filepath of the file to be opened;<br></br>
            - the mode for opening;
             <br></br><br></br>
            Example: <code>open("file.txt", "w")</code><br></br>
            This will open a file named file.txt placed in the same 
            directory as the <code>.py</code> script.

            <br></br><br></br>
            Enumerations in Python are implemented by using the module named 
            "enum".
            <br></br><br></br>
            Enumerations are created using classes. 
            Enums have names and values 
            associated with them.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Enums can be displayed as string or repr.<br></br>
            Enums can be checked for their types using type().<br></br>
            The "name" keyword is used to display the name of the enum
            member.
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of enums in Python:

            <green>Function overloading in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In Python function overloading works different as compared to other 
            OOP programming
            languages: the methods can be overloaded but only the 
            latest defined method can be used.
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of function overloading in Python:

#First product takes 2 arguments:
def product(a, b):
    p = a * b
    print(p)
 
#Second product method 3 arguments:
def product(a, b, c):
    p = a * b*c
    print(p)
 
#Uncommenting the below line shows an error
#product(4, 5)
 
 
#This line will call the second product method
product(4, 5, 5)
</code>

            <green>Overloading behaviour in a single function:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A method can be implemented in such a way that it responds differently
            based on the arguments passed to it. This will result in a behaviour
            which is similarly obtained via method overloading in other programming
            languages.
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of efficient overloading
#behavior:

#Function to take multiple arguments
def add(datatype, *args):
 
    #if datatype is int
    #initialize answer as 0
    if datatype == 'int':
        answer = 0
 
    #if datatype is str
    #initialize answer as ''
    if datatype == 'str':
        answer = ''
 
    #Traverse through the arguments
    for x in args:
 
        #This will do addition if the
        #arguments are int. Or concatenation
        #if the arguments are str
        answer = answer + x
 
    print(answer)
 
 
#Integer

            <br></br><br></br>
            Method overloading can also be achieved by using a decorator. 
            The method everloading via decorator allows using all the 
            defined versions of the method.

            <green>Multithreading in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            In Python: multithreading is the action of executing tasks simultaneously 
            (in parallel) in order to increase the speed of execution.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>GIL or Global Interpreter Lock:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python Global Interpreter Lock or GIL is an important 
            part of multithreading programming. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python Global Interpreter Lock it's a mutex or a type 
            of process lock used when working with multiple processes. 
            It allows only one thread to hold the control of 
            the Python interpreter. 
            This means that only one thread can be in a state of 
            execution at any point in time. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The impact of the GIL isn’t visible to developers who execute 
            single-threaded programs but it can be a performance bottleneck in 
            CPU-bound and multi-threaded code.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python uses reference counting for memory management. 
            It means that 
            objects created in Python have a reference count variable that 
            keeps track of the number of references that point to the object. 
            <br></br>
            When this count reaches zero and no variable is referencing the 
            object stored in the heap memory, 
            the heap memory occupied by the object is released 
            (deallocated).
            <br></br><br></br>
            The problem was that this reference count variable needed protection 
            from race conditions where two threads increase or decrease 
            its value 
            simultaneously. If this happens, it can cause either leaked memory that 
            is never released or, even worse, incorrectly release of the
            the memory while a reference to that object still exists. 
            This can cause crashes or other "weird" bugs within the 
            Python programs.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>GIL was introduced in order to fix these issues.</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Generally, Python uses a single thread to run a single process.
            We get the same performance result of the single-threaded and 
            multithreading processes using the GIL. 
            It restricts achieving multithreading in Python because it prevents 
            the threads and works as a single thread.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Python-related Multithreading Drawbacks:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            1. One GIL is used for all threads, and threads are limited by 
            GIL;
            <br></br><br></br>
            2. Multithreading has no effect for CPU-bound tasks due to 
            the GIL, 
            meaning we'll notice no improvements in the performance when it comes to these sort 
            of tasks;
            <br></br>
            CPU-bound tasks are those that require a significant amount of computational 
            resource.

            <br></br><br></br>
            By using multiprocessing in Python the 
            Global Interpreter Lock limitations can be overcome.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than 
            one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system 
            are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system 
            allocates these threads to the processor cores improving the performance 
            of the system.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>Pool class</code> in Python's multiprocessing module provides 
            convenient means of managing a pool of worker processes. It comes with 
            built-in methods that offer structured ways to distribute tasks 
            among these processes.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>Pool class</code> represents a pool of worker processes. It has 
            methods which allows 
            tasks to be offloaded/distributed to the worker cores/processes 
            in few different ways.

            <green>Namespaces in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python namespaces are collections of different 
            objects that are associated with 
            unique names whose lifespan depends on the scope of a variable.
            <br></br>
            A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. 
            This is called scope.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The scope is a 
            region from where we can access a particular object.
            <br></br><br></br>
            There are three levels 
            of scopes: built-in (outermost), 
            global, and local.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Built-in scope:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The built-in scope is automatically loaded by Python when you run a 
            program or script. 
            It contains names that are built into Python, such as 
            keywords, functions, exceptions, 
            and other attributes. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Global scope:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A variable created in the main body of the Python 
            code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope.
            Global variables are available from within any scope, 
            global and local.
            The global keyword makes the variable global.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Local scope:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope 
            of that function, and can only be used inside that function.
            The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables 
            inside nested functions. A nested function is a function defined within a function.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The nonlocal keyword makes the variable belong to the outer function.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Variables are names (identifiers) that map to objects. 
            A namespace is a dictionary of variable names (keys)
            and their corresponding objects (values).
            <br></br><br></br>
            A Python statement can access variables in a 
            local namespace and in the global namespace. 
            If a local and a global variable have the same name,
            the local variable shadows the global variable.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Python makes educated guesses on whether variables are 
            local or global. It assumes that any variable assigned 
            with a value within a function is local.
            Therefore, in order to assign a value to a global variable 
            within a function, you must first use the global specifier.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Within Python namespaces and scopes are in a tight relationship. 
            For example: 
            the global namespace can be seen as a collection of global variables 
            which have 
            global scope, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in the program. 
            The global
            namespace contains local namespaces for each function/method/loop an 
            other entities
            defining local scopes.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Scope refers to the coding region from which a particular Python object 
            is accessible. 
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of namespace and scopes in Python:

#var1 is in the global namespace
#meaning var1 has global scope:
var1 = 5

def some_func():
 
    #var2 is in the local namespace 
    #meaning var1 has local scope:
    var2 = 6
    
    def some_inner_func():
 
        #var3 is in the nested local namespace
        #meaning var3 has nested local scope:
        var3 = 7

            <br></br>
            <green>Exception handling in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program 
            that disrupts the normal flow of the program's
            instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation 
            that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception.
            <br></br><br></br>
            An exception is a Python object that represents an error.
            <br></br>
<code>
#Example of exception handling 
#in Python:

#Handling exceptions:
#Example 1:
try:
    fh = open("file.txt", "a")
    fh.write("This line was added by Python Program.")
except IOError:
    print ("Error: can't find file or read \
        data from {0}" .format(fh.name))
else:
    print ("Written content in the file successfully!")
    fh.close()

#Example 2:
try:
    fh = open("file.txt", "r")
    fh.read(12)
except IOError:
    print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data \
        from {0}" .format(fh.name))
finally:
    print ("Not working!")


#Raising an exception:
level=1
if level &lt; 1:
      raise Exception('level &lt; 1')

#Creating user-defined exception:
#Example 3:
class MyError(Exception):
     def __init__(self, value):
         self.value = value
     def __str__(self):
         return repr(self.value)

#Catching user-defined exceptions:
try:
    raise MyError(2*2)
except MyError as e:
     print ("My exception occurred, value: \
        {0}" .format (e.value))

            All string methods returns new values. They do not change
            the original string.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>capitalize()</code><br></br>

            <code>casefold()</code><br></br>
            Converts string into lower case.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>center()</code><br></br>
            Returns a centered string.
            <br></br><br></br>

        <regular-expressions>
            A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps 
            matching or finding other strings or sets of 
            strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Regular expressions in Python:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The re module offers a set of functions that allow working with 
            regular expressions:
            <br></br><br></br>
            The <code>match()</code> function attempts to match RE (Regular Expression) 
            pattern to string with optional flags.
            <br></br>
            It returns a match object on success, 
            <code>None</code> on failure. 
            <br></br>
            The <code>search()</code> function searches for first occurrence of 
            RE pattern within string with optional flags.
            <br></br>
            The <code>match()</code> checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while 
            <code>search()</code> checks for a match anywhere in the string.
            <br></br>
            The <code>sub()</code> function replaces all occurrences of the pattern in the 
            string with <code>repl</code>.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>The match() function:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Syntax: <code>re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)</code> where:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>pattern</code><br></br>
            This is the regular expression to be matched.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>string</code><br></br>
            This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern 
            at the beginning of string.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>flags</code><br></br>
            You can specify different flags using bitwise OR (<code>|</code>). 
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>The sub() function:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Syntax: <code>re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)</code> where:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>pattern</code><br></br>
            Denotes the string/pattern that needs to be replaced.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>repl</code><br></br>
            Denotes the string/pattern with which the pattern is replaced.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>string</code><br></br>
            Denotes the string on which the <code>re.sub()</code> operation will 
            be executed.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>count</code><br></br>
            Denotes the number of replacements that should occur.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <code>flags</code><br></br>
            Serves to modify the behavior of the regular expression operation.

            <green>What is an ECU?</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The ECU also known as the Electronic Control Unit or as some refer to as “Engine Control Units” (Electronic Control Unit 
            is actual correct term) is a computer within  a vehicle that controls how other components work.  In a nutshell it is a 
            computer with software installed and this software can be removed, changed, upgraded just like any other computer.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <img class="database_image" src="./website_resources/local/database/pictures/ecu.png" alt="ecu picture"></img>
            <br></br><br></br>
            It has input sensors where information about the car is sent back to the ECU and output sensors to send information 
            out to the components to tell them how to behave.  
            <br></br><br></br>
            If the car was a human, the ECU would be the brain, it has input 
            sensors (nerves) telling the brain information about where our parts of body are (for example if we are in an 
            uncomfortable position), but also has output sensors to tell the body what to do (for example moving our legs into a 
            more comfortable position). 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A concrete example of how an ECU operates in a vehicle would be controlling the fuelling into the engine.  
            The ECU would receive information about how much fuel is entering the chamber of the engine and will send out 
            instructions to reduce it or raise it if it senses it not currently at the correct flow. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>What is AutoSAR?</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            AUTOSAR is an open system architecture for automotive software development and provides standards for developing common 
            automotive software applications. It is a growing and evolving standard that defines a layered architecture for the software.
            <br></br><br></br>
            AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is primarily focused on the development of software architecture for 
            Electronic Control Units (ECUs),  but its applications extend beyond just ECUs. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Here’s a breakdown of its uses:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>ECUs:</brown>
            <br></br>
            The primary focus of AUTOSAR is to standardize the software architecture for ECUs, which are critical 
            components in vehicles that control various functions (like engine management, safety systems, etc).
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Software Components:</brown>
            <br></br>
            AUTOSAR facilitates the development of reusable software components that can be integrated into different ECUs, 
            promoting interoperability among various manufacturers.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Vehicle Networks:</brown>
            <br></br>
            AUTOSAR also plays a role in defining communication protocols and standards for vehicle networks, allowing different 
            ECUs to communicate effectively.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Safety and Security:</brown>
            <br></br>
            It provides guidelines and frameworks for developing safety-critical systems, which are essential for modern vehicles, 
            especially with the rise of autonomous driving technologies.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Integration with Other Systems:</brown>
            <br></br>
            While its primary focus is on ECUs, AUTOSAR can also be integrated with other automotive systems, such as infotainment 
            and telematics, enhancing the overall vehicle architecture.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The classic AUTOSAR platform runs on a microcontroller and is divided into 3 main layers:
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li>Basic Software Architecture - It is common to any AUTOSAR ECU.</li>
                <li>AUTOSAR Runtime Environment</li>
                <li>Application Layer</li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            <img class="database_image" src="./website_resources/local/database/pictures/autosar_architecture.png" alt="autosar architecture"></img>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Basic Software Architecture (BSW)</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Basic Software Architecture (BSW) is the lowest layer of 3 main layers. It is the layer in direct contact with the hardware part 
            (the microcontroller).
            <br></br><br></br>
            AUTOSAR Basic Software Architecture consists of hundreds of software modules structured in different sublayers (Services Layer, ECU Abstraction Layer, 
            Microcontroller Abstraction Layer, Complex Drivers, Operating System) and 
            it is common to any AUTOSAR ECU. This means the supplier who has designed BSW can share it with other suppliers that are 
            working on ECUs of engine, gearbox, etc.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Runtime Environment Layer (RTE)</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            AUTOSAR Runtime Environment is a middleware layer of the AUTOSAR software architecture between the BSW and the application 
            layer and provides communication services for the application software.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The purpose of RTE is to act as the middle-man between the software components. Example: if we have 2 software components 
            SWC A and SWC B, in order for SWC A to use some variables or functions from SWC B, the components SWC A it will have to connect 
            to the RTE which then will connect SWC A to SWC B through a series of interfaces for Reading/Writing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Application Layer</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The application layer is the highest layer of the AUTOSAR software architecture and supports custom functionalities 
            implementation. This layer consists of the specific software components and many applications which perform specific 
            tasks as per instructions.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The AUTOSAR application layer consists of three components which are: application software components, ports of software 
            components, and port interfaces.
            <br></br><br></br>
            AUTOSAR ensures standardized interfaces for the software components within the application layer and these software 
            components help in generating simple applications to support the vehicle functions.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Virtual Function Bus (VFB)</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Imagine a city with roads (VFB) connecting different buildings (SWCs). Each building has doorways (ports) that allow 
            people (data) to enter and exit. The doorways have specific rules (interfaces) about who can enter and what they can
            bring (data types). Connectors act as the pathways between doorways, allowing people to move between buildings.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The communication between the software components is enabled via specific ports using a Virtual Function Bus (VFB).
            <br></br>
            These ports facilitate communication between the software components within the Application Layer, between the 
            software components within the Basic Software Layer, and also across these 2 different layers together. This means
            you can connect from anywhere to anywhere.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The above-explained architecture of AUTOSAR is its classic platform, which supports real-time requirements and 
            safety constraints. Based on the microcontroller, the classic platform is capable of supporting applications in the 
            field of networking and security by allowing ECUs to access vehicle sensors and actuators.

        <ecu-communication>
            ECUs are the brains behind various functions in vehicles, and they communicate through specific networks. 
            Modern vehicles can have over 100 ECUs, each responsible for different tasks, such as engine management, 
            transmission control, safety systems, and infotainment.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In a network: ECUs are connected through various data buses, allowing them to send and receive messages. 
            Each ECU can read data from the bus and respond accordingly.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Broadcasting:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            When one ECU sends a message, all other ECUs on the bus can receive it, 
            allowing for efficient communication. Since all the data transmitted from the ECUs is available on the bus, the
            ECUs can be programmed to filter messages based on specific criteria, such as message identifiers. 
            This means they only process messages that are relevant to their function.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A PDU (Protocol Data Unit) is typically seen as a message in higher-level communication protocols, containing 
            the data and control information needed for a full communication exchange.
            In lower-level protocols like CAN, a PDU can be seen as the data part within a frame, but it’s still part of 
            the larger structure.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Message Structure:</green>
            <br></br> <br></br>
            The data is transmitted by ECUs in the form of messages, which include:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Identifier:</brown> 
             <br></br>
            A message identifier is a unique identifier assigned to each message transmitted over the 
            network. It serves several important purposes:
            <ul class="enumeration">
            <li><indigo>Priority Assignment:</indigo> The message identifier determines the priority of the message. 
            <br></br>
            In CAN networks, lower numerical values indicate higher priority. This means that if two messages are sent simultaneously, 
            the one with the lower identifier will take precedence.</li>
            <li><indigo>Message Routing:</indigo> The identifier helps in routing messages to the appropriate ECUs. 
            Each ECU can be programmed to listen for specific identifiers, ensuring that it only processes relevant messages.</li>
            <li><indigo>Data Association:</indigo> Each identifier is associated with specific data, source, and destination nodes. 
            This association allows ECUs to understand the context of the data being transmitted. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            The message identifier is used by ECUs to filter the messages from the bus. 
            If an ECU receives a message from the bus it will first check if the message is meant to be processed by its software or not.
            <br></br>
            If the message is not meant for the ECU which received it then it will be blocked by its network driver.

            <brown>Communication Protocols</brown>
            <br></br>
            ECUs communicate using various protocols, which define how data is transmitted. The most common protocols include:
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li><indigo>Controller Area Network (CAN):</indigo> A robust vehicle bus standard that allows ECUs to 
                communicate with each other without a host computer. It is designed for real-time applications where low latency is crucial.
                <br></br>
                CAN typically supports speeds up to 1 Mbps. 
                It is used for: fuel injection system, ignition system, emissions control, breaking system etc. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                The CAN bus enables quick and reliable sharing of information between the car's brakes and engine. 
                For instance, in anti-lock braking systems (ABS), the CAN protocol helps in coordinating 
                the braking force applied to each wheel.
                <br></br>
                CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate) enhances the capabilities of the traditional CAN protocol by allowing for 
                higher data rates and larger payloads.
                </li>
                <li><indigo>Ethernet:</indigo> supports much higher speeds, ranging from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps and beyond, 
                making it suitable for high-bandwidth applications. Ethernet generally uses a star topology 
                and can support a more complex network structure with switches and routers.</li>
                <li><indigo>FlexRay:</indigo> A high-speed bus that supports time-triggered communication, often used in safety-critical applications. 
                Supports data rates of up to 10 Mbps. It utilizes a time-triggered communication method, allowing for deterministic 
                data transmission. This means that messages are sent at predefined times, ensuring reliability and synchronization.</li>
                <li><indigo>Local Interconnect Network (LIN):</indigo> A simpler, lower-cost network used for less critical functions. 
                <br></br>
                LIN, typically supports data rates up to 20 Kbps, 
                making it suitable for simpler applications where high speed is not critical such as: window lifts, seat adjustments, 
                and interior lighting. </li>
                <li><indigo>Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST):</indigo> Primarily used for multimedia applications in vehicles, enabling high-speed data 
                transmission for audio, video, and other media content. It operates on a peer-to-peer basis, allowing multiple devices to 
                communicate simultaneously</li>

            <brown>Data Buses</brown>
            <br></br>
            All ECUs are connected to a single data line, known as a bus. This bus allows information to be transmitted between 
            ECUs. 
            <br></br>
            For example:
            In a CAN bus, messages are sent as packets, and each ECU can listen to the bus and respond to messages relevant to 
            its application.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>How Communication Works:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Message Transmission</indigo>
            <br></br>
            When an ECU needs to send data (like engine temperature), it creates a message and places it on the bus.
            Other ECUs on the network can read this message and respond accordingly.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Priority and Arbitration</indigo>
            <br></br>
            In a CAN network, messages have different priorities. If two messages are sent simultaneously, 
            the one with the higher priority will be transmitted first.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Error Handling</indigo>
            <br></br>
            ECU networks are designed with error detection and correction mechanisms to ensure reliable communication. 
            If a message is corrupted, the receiving ECU can request a retransmission.

            <brown>Transmission of messages:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            A message can also be formed from multiple frames, when the transmission of whole message is not possible. 
            <br></br>
            Example: In CAN (Controller Area Network), the standard frame format allows for a Data Field of only up to 8 bytes. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            A CAN Frame is an actual PDU/message for CAN protocol in AUTOSAR which consists of following:
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Identifier:</indigo> 11-bit or 29-bit ID (depending on standard or extended format).<br></br>
            <indigo>Control Field:</indigo> Data length code (DLC), which specifies the length of the Data Field.<br></br>
            <indigo>Data Field:</indigo> This can contain up to 8 bytes of actual data being transferred.<br></br>
            <indigo> CRC:</indigo> For error checking.<br></br>
            <indigo>Acknowledgment:</indigo> A signal confirming successful reception of the frame.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In this case: to send larger messages (i.e., PDUs larger than 8 bytes), the CAN protocol uses a mechanism known as 
            segmentation and reassembly. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Larger PDUs (such as those needed for diagnostic messages or large data transfers) 
            can be sent by breaking the data into smaller chunks. These chunks are sent across multiple frames, 
            and the receiving ECU must reassemble the data back into the original message.
            <br></br><br></br>
            This segmentation and reassembly is typically done using higher-layer protocols like ISO-TP (ISO 15765-2) or 
            UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services), which define how the data is split into multiple frames.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Steps for Segmentation and Reassembly:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Segmentation:</indigo>
            <br></br>
            The PDU is split into smaller pieces, each fitting within the 8-byte data field limit of the CAN frame.
            Each segment is sent as a separate CAN frame, and these frames are linked using specific identifiers (such as a 
            Sequence Number and a Unique Message Identifier).
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Transmission of Multiple Frames:</indigo>
            <br></br>
            The first CAN frame will carry the initial part of the data, while the subsequent frames carry the remaining chunks.
            A special control byte (such as a Sequence Number) is included in the header of each frame to help the receiving ECU 
            reassemble the full message.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Reassembly:</indigo>
            <br></br>
            The receiving ECU listens for each frame, identifies the Sequence using the Control Information, and reassembles the data 
            into the original PDU once all the frames are received.
            <br></br>
            The receiving ECU may also check for any errors or missing frames.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Example of Multi-Frame Transmission:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Suppose a diagnostic message requires 20 bytes of data.
            <br></br>
            This data would be split into 3 frames:
            <br></br><br></br>
            The first frame would carry the first 8 bytes.<br></br>
            The second frame would carry the next 8 bytes.<br></br>
            The third frame would carry the remaining 4 bytes.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Each of these frames would have identifiers or Sequence Numbers that allow the receiving ECU to know how to 
            reassemble the data.
            <br></br><br></br>
            PDUs larger than 8 bytes can be transmitted in a single frame through CAN FD 
            (Flexible Data-rate) protocol, which allows for larger data payloads and higher data 
            transfer rates with a Data Field size of up to 64 bytes.
            <br></br>

        <can-protocol>
            The CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol is a robust vehicle bus standard designed to 
            facilitate efficient communication primarily between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in 
            automotive and industrial applications.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A simple CAN (Controller Area Network) typically consists of two wires. 
            CAN High (CANH) - the wire which carries the high voltage level of the signal and CAN Low (CANL) - the wire which 
            carries the low voltage level of the signal.
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li>The two wires are essential for proper 
                communication between devices on the network.</li>
                <li>Often, these wires are twisted together to reduce electromagnetic 
                interference, which helps maintain signal integrity.</li>
                <li>At each end of the CAN bus, termination resistors are 
                usually added to prevent signal reflections.</li>
                <li>
                In some cases, a four-wire configuration might be used to include additional wires for power and ground.

            <green>Information Transmission in CAN:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The transmission of information through the CAN (Controller Area Network) utilizes a differential signaling 
            method between the CAN High (CANH) and CAN Low (CANL) wires.
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li><indigo>Differential Signaling:</indigo>
                The CAN bus uses a differential wired-AND signaling technique. This means that the information is transmitted as a 
                difference in voltage between the two wires.
                When data is sent, one wire (CANH) carries a higher voltage, while the other wire (CANL) carries a lower voltage.
                </li>
                <li><indigo>Dominant and Recessive States:</indigo>
                When a dominant bit is transmitted, CANH rises to approximately 3.5V, and CANL drops to about 1.5V. 
                This creates a differential voltage of 2 volts (3.5V - 1.5V).
                <br></br>
                In the recessive state, both wires are at the same voltage level, typically around 2.5V. 
                This indicates that no data is being transmitted.
                </li>
                <li><indigo>Bit Transmission:</indigo>
                The bits are sent as high/low signals, which can be visualized as pulses or waves traveling down the wires. 
                The transition between dominant and recessive states encodes the data being transmitted.
                </li>
                <li><indigo>Error Detection:</indigo>
                The differential nature of the signaling helps in error detection. If there is a fault in one of the wires, 
                the system can still interpret the data correctly by comparing the voltage levels of CANH and CANL.
                </li>
               <li><indigo>Robustness:</indigo>
                This method of transmission is highly robust against electromagnetic interference, making it ideal for automotive and 
                industrial applications where reliability is crucial.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            CAN uses a bit-oriented protocol: Instead of sending 8 bytes at once, CAN transmits data bit by bit. 
            So, for an 8-byte message, you'd be sending 64 individual bits (8 bytes * 8 bits/byte).
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In other words we send out 64 pairs of CANH and CANL.
            <br></br><br></br>
            
            The time needed to send the 8-byte message through the bus can be calculated as follows:
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li>The speed of the CAN bus can vary, but a common speed is 500 kbps (kilobits per second).</li>
                <li>
                At 500 kbps, the time to transmit a single bit is calculated as 1/speed:
                <br></br>
                1/500 000 = 2 microseconds
                </li>
                <li>
                Time needed to transmit the whole message would be: 
                <br></br>
                    2 microseconds * 64 = 128 microseconds.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            <green>CAN Transceiver</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            The CAN Transceiver acts as a bridge between the CAN bus and the Microcontroller (MCU). 
            It converts the differential voltage signals on the CAN High (CANH) and CAN Low (CANL) lines into a 
            single-ended digital signal that the Microcontroller (MCU) can understand.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Differential Signal Interpretation:</brown>
            <br></br>
            The transceiver interprets the voltage levels as follows:
            <ul class="enumeration">
            <li>Dominant State: When the voltage difference indicates a dominant bit (e.g., CANH at approximately 3.5V and CANL at about 
            1.5V), the transceiver recognizes this as a binary 1.
            </li>
            <li>Recessive State: When both wires are at the same voltage level (around 2.5V), it is interpreted as a binary 0.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            <brown>Digital Signal Outputting:</brown>
            <br></br>
            The transceiver outputs a digital signal (high or low) to the Microcontroller (MCU) based on the interpreted 
            voltage levels. This digital signal can then be processed by the Microcontroller (MCU) for further actions, 
            such as data logging, control commands, or communication with other devices.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Error Detection Scenario in CAN Transceiver:</brown>
            <br></br>
            Imagine a CAN bus with two wires, CANH and CANL, transmitting a dominant bit (1). 
            This means CANH should be at a higher voltage (around 3.5V) than CANL (around 1.5V).
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Fault:</indigo> Let's say there's a fault in the CANH wire, causing it to short-circuit to ground. 
            This would drop the voltage on CANH to 0V.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>With Differential Signaling:</indigo>
            <br></br>
            The CAN transceiver compares the voltage levels of CANH and CANL. It sees that CANH is at 0V, and CANL is still at 1.5V.
            <br></br>
            The transceiver recognizes this voltage difference as an error. It knows that the intended signal was a dominant bit (1), 
            even though the CANH wire is faulty.
            <br></br><br></br>
            This allows the transceiver to flag the error and potentially request a retransmission of the message.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Without Differential Signaling:</indigo>
            <br></br>
            A standard single-ended system would only see the voltage on CANH as 0V. It would incorrectly 
            interpret this as a recessive bit (0), even though the intended signal was a dominant bit (1).
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Key Features of the CAN Protocol:</green>
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Multi-Master Configuration:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            All nodes (ECUs) on the network can send and receive messages, allowing for a decentralized communication system.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            CAN uses a method to manage access to the bus, ensuring that if two nodes attempt to send messages 
            simultaneously, the one with the higher priority will continue while the other will back off.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Message Prioritization:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Each message has a unique identifier that determines its priority. Lower numerical values indicate higher 
            priority, allowing critical messages to be transmitted first.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Error Detection and Handling:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            CAN includes several mechanisms for error detection, such as Checksums / CRC and Acknowledgment (ACK) bits, ensuring 
            reliable communication. If an error is detected, the message is retransmitted.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The acknowledgement (ACK) bit is used to confirm the reception of the message. 
            So the ECU receiving the message sends out a reply that the reception was successful.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>How does Acknowledgement (ACK) Bit work?</indigo>
            <br></br>
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li>When a sender transmits a data frame, it includes an Acknowledgement (ACK) bit at the end of the frame. 
                </li>
                <li>Each ECU that successfully receives the data frame checks for errors. If the frame is received without errors, 
                the receiving ECU sets the Acknowledgement (ACK) bit to a dominant state (logic 0). 
                </li>
                <li>The ACK bit is dominant, meaning that if at least one ECU acknowledges 
                the message, the ACK bit will be recognized as dominant. 
                </li>
                <li>If no ECU acknowledges the message (i.e., all nodes detect an error), 
                the ACK bit remains in a recessive state (logic 1).
                </li>
                <li>The sender monitors the bus for the ACK bit. If it detects the dominant 
                state, it knows that at least one ECU has successfully received the message. If it does not detect the dominant state, 
                it assumes that there was an error in transmission. 
                </li>
                <li>If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment, it may retransmit the message, depending on the 
                error handling strategy implemented.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            <indigo>Importance of the Acknowledgement (ACK) Bit</indigo>
            <br></br>
            The ACK bit ensures that messages are acknowledged, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of 
            communication in a network with multiple nodes. It helps in identifying transmission errors, allowing 
            for corrective actions to be taken.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Broadcast Communication:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Messages are broadcasted to all nodes on the network, meaning that every ECU can "hear" all transmissions. 
            This is efficient for applications where multiple devices need to respond to the same data.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If the information that the ECU "hears" on the bus is not meant for its functioning, then the messages will be blocked by its 
            CAN Controller / CAN Driver and it will not reach the upper software layers.
            This filtering is performed using the Unique Identifiers from the PDU / Frame.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <indigo>Difference between Message/PDU and Frame</indigo>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Both Frames and Message/PDUs can be used to reffer to the same thing.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In a CAN network, messages transferred across the network are referred to as frames. 
            Each frame contains essential information that allows ECUs to communicate effectively. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            When the transmission of a Message/PDU within a single frame is not possible due to the size limitations (8 bytes for Data Field), 
            the Message/PDU can be transmitted across multiple frames, in segmented parts. This process is called "Segmentation and Reassembly".
            <br></br><br></br>
            A Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is a generic term used to describe a unit of data specified in a protocol at any layer of 
            the OSI model. It represents the data that is transmitted over a network and can vary in structure depending on the 
            protocol being used.
            <br></br><br></br>
            A frame is a specific type of PDU used at the data link layer of the OSI model. It is a structured unit of data that includes not only 
            the payload (the actual data) but also control information necessary for data transmission.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In other words: A Message/PDU is a term used to reffer to the packed data within the ECU, where as the Frame is term used 
            to reffer to the packed data travelling through the bus from one ECU to another. So once a transmitted PDU has left the ECU 
            it turns into a Frame, then the Frame is read by the recipient ECU and turns back into a Message/PDU.
            <br></br><br></br>
            If the Message/PDU was receiving across multiple frames, it will be reassembled back together into a single unit once all the frames 
            carrying the segmented parts of the Message/PDU were received.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <brown>Data Rates:</brown>
            <br></br><br></br>
            CAN supports data rates up to 1 Mbps, making it efficient for many applications.  
            A rate of 1 megabit per second (Mbps) means that the network can send 1 million bits of data every second.
            <br></br><br></br>
            At 1 Mbps, the CAN protocol can transfer up to 8 bytes of data per frame. This is the maximum payload size for a standard CAN frame, 
            which is suitable for many automotive and industrial applications. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            While 1 Mbps is effective for many applications, 
            it can be a limiting factor for systems that require higher data throughput. This is where CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate) 
            comes into play, allowing for higher speeds (up to 5 Mbps) and larger data payloads.
            <br></br><br></br>
            <green>Types of CAN Frames</green>

            <indigo>Data Frame:</indigo>
            <br></br>
            The most common type, used to transmit data from one ECU to another.

            <indigo>Remote Frame:</indigo>
            <br></br>
            Requests data from another ECU without carrying any data itself. 
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li>When an ECU needs data from another ECU, it sends a Remote Frame. 
                This remote frame includes the identifier of the data frame it wants to receive. 
                </li>
                <li>Upon receiving the Remote Frame, 
                the targeted ECU recognizes the request and prepares to send the corresponding Data Frame.
                The Data Frame will then be transmitted back to the requesting ECU, containing the requested information.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            <indigo>Error Frame:</indigo>
            <br></br>
            Indicates that an error has occurred in the transmission, prompting corrective actions. The Error Frame consists of 
            a 6-bit field that indicates the presence of an error. It is transmitted as a series of dominant bits (0s) or 
            recessive bits (1s), depending on the type of error detected and a delimiter that indicates the end of the Error Frame.
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li>Each node on the CAN bus continuously monitors the messages being transmitted. If a node detects an error 
                (such as a bit error, format error, or acknowledgment error), it triggers the transmission of an Error Frame.
                </li>
                <li>
                Once an Error Frame is generated, it is immediately sent onto the CAN bus. All other nodes on the network 
                recognize this frame and take appropriate action, such as stopping their current transmission and preparing 
                to retransmit the message that caused the error.
                </li>
                <li>
                After the Error Frame is sent, the node that detected the error will enter an error state. There are different 
                error states (active, passive, and bus-off) that determine how the node will behave in future communications.
                </li>

            <br></br>
            Used to signal that a node is temporarily unable to process incoming messages. 
            An Overload Frame is transmitted when a node needs more time to process incoming messages. 
            This can occur if:
            <ul class="enumeration">
                <li>The node is busy processing previous messages.</li>
                <li>The node's buffer is full, and it cannot accept new messages at that moment.</li>
            </ul>
