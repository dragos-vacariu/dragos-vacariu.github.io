                <p>
                Through this self-made endeavor, a personal portfolio was built meticulously curated that should 
                backup the evolution of my abilities.

                <p>
                There were no other parties involved in this build-up. 
                This is not the subject to collaborative work display, but an independent drive to push boundaries 
                and expand my knowledge and understanding over various concepts that are relevant to my line of work.
