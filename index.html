                <p>
                Welcome to my personal sandbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                This GitHub-hosted portfolio serves as a living collection of projects, ranging from interactive frontend 
                applications to more complex softwares built using various programming languages and frameworks.
                Some projects are fully functional, while others are still in progress, with many existing only as 
                explorations of different technologies, concepts, and problem-solving approaches. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This is not a traditional showcase of polished applications. Instead, it reflects my ongoing learning 
                process — a space where I test ideas, refine my skills, experiment, study, and 
                document the steps taken towards pushing the boundaries of understanding various aspects surrounding 
                software development.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                Within these pages, you’ll find projects that reflect real challenges, creative solutions, and my 
                long-term commitment towards improving as an all-round developer. Although, some projects may never be 
                "finished" in the conventional sense, each one represents a step forward in my journey of 
                mastering coding, design, and technology.
                The goal is to expand my expertise across the fields surrounding Information Technology, by 
                learning as much as I can on my own, without relying on the resources that typically come with 
                a specific job within the industry.

                This sandbox features a variety of frontend applications, prototypes, code snippets, design mockups, 
                contextual webpages, or just simply crafted solutions, all publicly 
                accessible on <a href="https://github.com/dragos-vacariu?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>. 
                <p>
                </p>
                While some projects demonstrate complete functionality, others remain open-ended 
                experiments, snapshots of my thinking process, problem-solving strategies, or exploration playgrounds for 
                new technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                Every showcased project has been built independently. The efforts commited are not the subject to 
                collaborative work display, 
                but rather a testament to my ability to learn, adapt, overcome and improve.

                The showcased projects feature some of the most modern tools and technologies available today:

                <p>
                I understand the importance of continuous learning and I aim to become proficient in what I do. 
                While I may not have access to high-end 
                platforms and enterprise frameworks, I embrace the challenge of mastering core programming principles, 
                problem-solving strategies, and the evolving landscape of technology. 
                Alongside coding, I place great emphasis on structured 
                documentation, ensuring that even unfinished projects serve as useful references for understanding 
                complex concepts and retaining knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                For me, software development transcends beyond productive development: implementing or thinking code. 
                It's a holistic process deeply rooted in discovery and iteration. It involves meticulous research to 
                identify the optimal solutions, a persistent quest for knowledge to stay informed about the latest 
                advancements, and the humility to seek help and guidance when needed. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                This extends beyond individual growth; mentoring and helping others significantly enhances my own 
                understanding. 
                The act of explaining complex concepts to others forces me to articulate my own knowledge, to identify gaps 
                in my understanding, and ultimately deepen my expertise. In essence, the teacher often learns as much as 
                the student. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Similarly, seeking help isn't a sign of weakness but a strategic move that benefits not only 
                seeker but also the team and the company. By openly asking for assistance, people foster collaboration, 
                share knowledge, and prevent potential roadblocks, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and effective 
                workflow.
