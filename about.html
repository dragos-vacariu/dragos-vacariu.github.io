			<h2>About:</h2>
			<h4>This page is used to summarize, self-assess and describe the technical aspects of my expertize, taking 
            under consideration the technologies used for the development of this Portfolio and the showcased applications 
            and materials.</h4>
			<h3>Self-Assessment Summary: </h3>
			<p id="html_css_info">
				<code>HTML & CSS</code> <br><br>
				Hands-on Experience: < 2 years; <br>
				- can design decent looking web templates;<br>
				- can handle the responsiveness of the web page; <br>
				- basic knowledge of photo editing; <br>
				- basic knowledge of color wheels for creating complementary colors & contrasts; <br>
				
				<br><b>Technical Background:</b> Been studying and practicing the web design tools through 
				the years and have reached the point where the skills and knowledge gathered can 
				assist in developing decent  looking web pages with responsive behaviour based 
				on the viewport size, device and or screen resolution. <br><br>
				Although, I've never worked within the web development industry, 
				I've become capable of debugging and fixing visual flaws, to 
				refactor and/or to reformat the content of a web page whilst gradually improving.<br>
			</p>
			
			<p id="javascript_info">
				<code>JavaScript</code> <br><br>
				Hands-on Experience: < 2 years; <br>
				- can design / implement basic client web-based applications; <br>
				- can design / implement low-medium complexity solutions; <br>
				- can make use of object oriented programming concepts; <br>
				- can make use of basic Angular functions and directives; <br>
				
				<br><b>Technical Background:</b> Been studying and practicing coding 
				in various programming languages while trying to solve same  challenges 
				with different approach, rules or limitations imposed by the language 
				or tool itself.<br><br> 
				Together: JavaScript, HTML and CSS provide the means to 
				both design something visually and code its behaviour at the same time. 
				In that regard I've been able to grow creatively whilst designinng and 
				developing several in-browser classic mini-games. 
				<br><br>Although I've only scratched the surface and I'm still lacking deep 
				knowledge of understanding of everything that JavaScript can offer, 
				I feel confident that I can learn more if given the chance.<br>

			<p id="c_language_info">
				<code>C Language</code> <br><br>
				Hands-on Experience: > 4 years; <br>
				- can design / implement low-medium complexity solutions;<br>
				- familiar with modular programming; <br>
				<br><b>Technical Background:</b> Been working with C language for several years 
				while helping on the development of various projects for embedded systems. <br>
			</p>
			
						
			<p id="python_info">
				<code>Python</code> <br><br>
				Hands-on Experience: < 2 years; <br>
				- can design / implement low-medium complexity solutions;<br>
				- familiar with modular programming;<br>
				- familiar with object oriented programming concepts;<br>
				- familiar with tkinter interface;<br>
				- familiar with exception handling & debugging;<br>
				<br><b>Technical Background:</b> Been interacting with Python for few years while using 
				various scripts for automated software development processes or for software testing 
				purposes. <br><br>
				Also been actively involved or participated on several occasions 
				in developing new features for existing scripts or developing something 
				from scratch either for home or industrial purposes.<br>
			</p>
			
			<p id="cpp_info">
				<code>C++</code> <br><br>
				Hands-on Experience: < 2 years; <br>
				- can design / implement low-medium complexity solutions; <br>
				- familiar with modular programming; <br>
				- familiar with object oriented programming concepts; <br>
				- basic knowledge and understanding of generic programming; <br>
				- familiar with .NET Windows Forms; <br>
				
				<br><b>Technical Background:</b> Grew familiar with the C language and all the experience 
				and handiness that comes from C is applicable within C++. 
				<br><br>In terms of OOP: I've been 	studying the usefulness and 
				applicability of it and I find it highly addictive. 
				It's very handy and professional having all the funcionality of an object 
				in the one place, highly reusable via inheritace, secured via encapsulation 
				and generically invokable through the objects of the derived classes via 
				polymorphism. <br><br>
				Although I didn't had the chance to use it professionally as 
				it requires more resources than other low-level complex datatypes, and it's 
				not very popular on the embedded systems, OOP is still one feature and 
				skill I'd like to further use, develop and master.<br>

			<p id="csharp_info">
				<code>C#</code> <br><br>
				Hands-on Experience: < 1 years; <br>
				- can design / implement low-medium complexity solutions; <br>
				- familiar with modular programming; <br>
				- familiar with object oriented programming concepts; <br>
				- familiar with .NET Windows Forms; <br>
				<br><b>Technical Background:</b> C# is very readable, 
				higher level and easier to use than C++, and it's a perfect match for developing 
				Windows Apps. I've been using C# and .NET for developing Windows App and designing 2D and 3D graphics environments 
				by the means of Unity Game Engine.<br><br>
