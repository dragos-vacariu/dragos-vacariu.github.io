                    While my professional experience is primarily rooted in self-directed projects, I have gained significant 
                    expertise in designing and developing 2D and 3D graphics environments using the Unity game engine. My experience includes:

                    <a href="./catalogue/Unity-Csharp-Projects/TowerBlocks.html">Project 1: Classic 2D Mini-Game Prototype:</a> Developed a playable prototype of a classic 2D mini-game, which involved 
                    implementing game mechanics, simple animations, texturing, GUI design, and coding. This project allowed me to 
                    explore the challenges faced by game developers and to gain a practical understanding of game engine physics 
                    and mechanics.

                     Designed and developed an unfinished 3D environment for a 
                    racing game, utilizing available free resources. This project further enhanced my skills in texturing, 3D modeling, 
                    and environment design.

                    <span class="header">Description:</span><br>
                    I am enthusiastic about Java Programming and I gained an extensive foundation through self-practice, 
                    exercises and exploration of the core features and functionalities surrounding this language while also 
                    improving my understanding over the OOP concepts.
                    <br>
                    <br><span class="header">Competences:</span><br>
                    &#10003; Solid understanding of fundamental Java syntax, data structures, and control flow. <br>
                    &#10003; Application of object-oriented programming concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism). <br>
                    &#10003; Ability to design and implement solutions to low-to-medium complexity problems. <br>
                    &#10003; Familiarity with the <span class="highlighted_element">Swing</span> library for basic GUI development. <br>
                    &#10003; Demonstrated ability to learn and apply new concepts independently through self-study.<br>
                    <br><span class="header">On-Job Experience:</span><br>
                    While my professional experience doesn't yet include Java, I have dedicated several weeks to studying the 
                    language and its core principles. Through coding challenges, exercises, and exploration of Java's fundamental 
                    features, I have built a strong foundation in the basics. This self-directed learning has deepened my 
                    understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, and I am eager to apply my 
                    knowledge to real-world projects.
